"1","From deliveries in Arizona to fish markets in California, coronavirus changes how we buy our food","","Business News","(Reuters) - Eric Cohn used to wear a respirator mask, goggles and gloves only to protect against mold and asbestos as he restored homes in Tucson, Arizona. Now he dons the same gear in his new job - shopping for quarantined customers. “People ask me where I get this mask every day,” the 34-year-old said. “They say: you look good! I say I’m not trying to look good. I’m trying to be safe.” With over 90% of the U.S. population under orders to stay home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Cohn is among a new class of front-line workers delivering food to people’s houses. These workers risk their own health every time they touch doors to enter supermarkets and restaurants, or approach homes where someone inside could be sick. But - with a record 10 million Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits in the last two weeks of March - many feel they have little choice if they want to pay their bills. Cohn said he often feels vulnerable in the supermarket checkout line as other customers get closer to him than the recommended 6 feet (1.8 meters). Once safely back in his car, he disinfects his gloved hands, steering wheel, door handles and phone. He often works 14 hours with a goal of making $200 a day. “If I didn’t have my own PPE, I don’t know if I would be OK with doing this,” he said, referring to personal protective equipment. Concerns about staff safety led a family in New York’s Brooklyn neighborhood to decide to close their three restaurants. Last week, Ix (pronounced “eesh”) made its last free deliveries of Guatemalan food to police, firefighters, doctors and nurses. “This was our baby. It was the dream come true. It’s hard to say goodbye to that,” said Ana Prince, one of the owners of Ix, which opened over three years ago. “I feel like I want to cry because you never want to see your business closing,” she said. “But everyone is healthy and we don’t want them to get sick. It could get worse. So for the health of everybody, we made the decision (to close), but it wasn’t easy at all,” said Prince. With restaurants closing and so many people ordering food from their homes, many Americans have found delivery slots at grocery stores evaporating. Some providers have tried to get around that by going direct to the consumer. In Lodi, Ohio, farmers have created a website offering weekly deliveries of vegetables, meats, cheeses and other fresh items. “It’s nice for us using the online order forms,” said Jimmy Myers, 33, one of the owners of Front 9 Farm. “We know that everything we harvest is going to be sold. There’s very little waste... We sell out of eggs within about two hours of loading the order form.” In California, Jordyn Kastlunger, who fishes commercially with her father Martin Kastlunger, sometimes sells the catches at the Tuna Harbor Dockside Market in San Diego. About 300 people recently lined up to buy fish at the market, standing on tape markers 6 feet apart. Police later asked them to increase the spacing to 12 feet. “My dad fishes for a variety of things so the only thing that’s really been impacted is crab, since processors don’t have as much bait to give,” Kastlunger said. “We’ve been doing OK. It’s definitely slower and harder.” Reporting by Cheney Orr in Tucson, Arizona; Bing Gaun in San Diego; Dane Rhys in Akron, Ohio and Anna Watts in New York; Writing by Lisa Shumaker; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien"
"2","Exclusive: BOJ to project economic contraction as pandemic damage deepens - sources","Leika Kihara","Business News","TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is likely to make a rare projection this month that the world’s third-largest economy will shrink this year, as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to push the country deep into recession, sources familiar with its thinking said. It would be the first time the BOJ has forecast a full-year contraction since 2014, when a sales tax hike triggered an economic slump. But the BOJ, in forecasts couched with unusually high levels of uncertainty, will cling to the view that after a severe downturn this quarter, Japan’s economy will gradually rebound toward the end of this year, the sources said. “Given what’s happening now, it’s hard to come up with a forecast of positive economic growth,” one of the sources said. “Any projection the BOJ makes shouldn’t be too out of line with how the general public feels about the economy,” another source said, a view echoed by two more sources. There is no consensus within the BOJ yet on whether such a gloomy projection would warrant additional monetary easing, as much would hinge on how long it takes for the pandemic to be contained, they said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. The BOJ could not be reached for comment. The BOJ will release fresh quarterly growth and price projections at its next rate review on April 27-28. In its last projections made in January, it expected the economy to grow 0.9% in the year that began in April. A new Reuters poll showed analysts expect the economy to shrink 2.1% this year as the outbreak wreaks havoc on business and daily life, with a majority projecting the BOJ will ramp up stimulus in April. The economy is forecast to shrink by an annualised 3.7% in January-March and 6.1% in April-June, the poll showed, after a sharp contraction late last year. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday declared a state of emergency to fight a rise in coronavirus infections in major population centres and rolled out a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package to soften the economic blow. The BOJ expanded monetary stimulus in an unscheduled policy meeting on March 16 to ease corporate funding strains and calm financial markets jolted by the health crisis. It pledged to buy more risky assets such as such as exchange-traded funds (ETF) and ramp up buying of commercial paper and corporate bonds to keep credit markets from freezing up. Uncertainty over how long it would take to contain the virus is making it difficult for policymakers to come up with growth projections, stoking market speculation the BOJ may not even produce them at the April rate review. While the hit to consumption from the crisis points to a deep recession, the BOJ is seen counting on the boost from the government’s stimulus package and early signs of a rebound in China’s economy to ease the pain, they say. “It’s impossible now to credibly project what could happen to Japan’s economy this year, as everything depends on how things unfold regarding the pandemic,” said former BOJ executive Kazuo Momma. “But I won’t be surprised if the economy contracts by more than 5%,” given the immediate hit to households and companies, said Momma, currently an economist at Mizuho Research Institute. In forecasts produced in April 2009 during the global financial crisis, the BOJ projected a 3.2% contraction for fiscal 2008 and a 3.1% decline the following year. “A forecast of a 5% contraction would be quite shocking, so the BOJ won’t go that far. But it may produce an estimate of 2-3% negative growth,” said a former BOJ board member, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

"3","Exclusive: China's central bank to step up easing, won't borrow Fed playbook - sources","Kevin Yao","Business News","BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s central bank will ramp up its policy easing to support the coronavirus-ravaged economy but debt worries and property risks will prevent it from following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s steep rate cuts or quantitative easing moves, policy sources said. China’s leaders have pledged to combat the impact from the pandemic that looks to have tipped the world’s second-largest economy into its first quarterly contraction in at least 30 years, as mounting job losses pose a threat to social stability. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will boost credit and lower funding costs, especially for small firms seen as vital for growth and jobs, and accommodate increased fiscal spending, according to three sources involved in internal policy discussions. The sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The PBOC said on Friday it was cutting reserve requirement ratio (RRR) - the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves - for the third time this year, and lowered interest rate on banks’ excess reserves for the first time since 2008. The central bank will largely rely on a mix of liquidity policy tools to support the economy, such as RRR and various lending facilities, and price-based tools including various market rates and its benchmark lending rate - the loan prime rate (LPR), the sources said. “The PBOC will step up monetary policy easing, but it’s impossible for it to follow the Federal Reserve,” said one of the sources. “The PBOC will take a step by step approach and reserve some ammunition.” The PBOC and the finance ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. The Fed slashed interest rates by a half percentage point on March 3 and by a full point was on March 15, bringing the Fed’s overnight borrowing rate for banks back to near zero, and restarted a quantitative easing programme. In recent years the PBOC, which uses multiple tools to control interest rates and money supply, has been trying to develop a single representative policy rate like the Fed’s funds rate. The PBOC is likely to cut the LPR on April 20, following a 20 basis point cut in the 7-day reverse repo rate on March 30, and trim the benchmark deposit rate in the coming months as consumer inflation is expected to ease, the sources said. The central bank has cut the LPR, which is set on the 20th of each month, by a total of 26 basis points since August - when it unveiled a key reform to use the LPR to replace the previous benchmark lending rate. The one-year LPR rate is currently at 4.05%. A deposit rate cut could help ease pressure on lenders and create more room for lowering lending rates, but such a move could be politically sensitive, given that real deposit rates are already deep in negative territory, the sources said. The PBOC has kept the benchmark deposit rate unchanged at 1.5% since October 2015. Consumer inflation was 5.2% in February. Vice PBOC governor Liu Guoqiang said last week that China would tread warily in cutting the benchmark deposit rate due to elevated inflation and the potential impact on ordinary savers. “We should continue to cut RRR and interest rates. But we should be worried about the side-effects if monetary policy easing becomes too strong, as we are still digesting the hangover from previous stimulus measures,” said a second source. “If more money flows into the property sector, it would fuel property speculation and lead to social problems.” Since 2016 Beijing has stepped up its de-leveraging campaign, but last year in its annual report the PBOC warned that financial risks “are still abundant, after accumulating rapidly in the past few years.” Since early February, the central bank has unveiled a raft of measures from cutting lending rates and making cheap loans at subsidized rates to providing payment relief to firms that have been hardest hit by the outbreak and virus containment measures. Yet, the PBOC’s current easing has been more measured than during the global financial crisis, when it slashed its key lending rate by a massive 216 basis points in late 2008. In the past month global policymakers have unveiled a burst of unprecedented stimulus to combat the coronavirus and prevent a deep worldwide recession. Leaders of the G20 have also pledged to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy to limit job and income losses from the pandemic, which has so far infected nearly 1.4 million people and killed more than 80,000 in over 200 countries. Chinese leaders, who have acknowledged the constraints on monetary policy, will lean on fiscal stimulus to spur infrastructure investment and consumption, the sources said. “Fiscal policy will play the main role (in supporting the economy), and monetary policy will actively cooperate with fiscal policy,” said another source. Lower interest rates will support the government’s spending plans and more fund injections from the central bank will help banks and firms buy government debt, the sources said. Beijing, mindful of the lessons learned in 2008-09 when a massive stimulus package saddled the economy with a mountain of debt, will make sure investment projects are more financially sound, the sources said. Policy sources have told Reuters that the Chinese government could expand the 2020 budget deficit to a record high. A central bank adviser has suggested that a growth target not even be set this year due to the uncertainty. But the sources said top leaders still want to set a growth target, albeit lower than the initially agreed goal of around 6%, ahead of the annual parliament meeting, which was originally scheduled for March 5 but was postponed due to the outbreak.

"4","EU ministers fail to agree coronavirus economic rescue in all-night talks","Jan Strupczewski, Francesco Guarascio","Business News","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers failed in all-night talks to agree an economic support package for their coronavirus-hit economies but will reconvene on Thursday to iron out remaining issues, which officials said were not insurmountable. Officials said a feud between Italy and the Netherlands over what conditions should be attached to euro zone credit for governments fighting the pandemic was blocking progress on measures worth half a trillion euros. “After 16 hours of discussions we came close to a deal but we are not there yet,” Eurogroup chairman Mario Centeno said. “I suspended the Eurogroup and (we will) continue tomorrow.” The finance ministers, who began talks at 1430 GMT on Tuesday and continued all night - with numerous breaks for bilateral negotiations - were trying to agree on measures to help governments, companies and individuals. The package is aimed at providing a cushion against the economic slump that the pandemic is expected to cause and to show solidarity among European Union countries in the crisis. But French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was quoted as saying at one point during the night in allusion to the wrangling, according to one official who participated: “Shame on you, shame on Europe. Stop this clownish show.” Officially, in a coordinated Twitter message with German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, Le Maire said: “We call on all European states to be up to the challenge posed by these exceptional times so that we can arrive at reaching an ambitious agreement.” Officials said the ministers could not settle on a common text because the Netherlands insisted credit from the euro zone for governments should come with conditions that would take into account, at a later stage, country-specific economic criteria. Italy was ready to accept a generic reference to the need to stick to EU budget rules, but nothing more specific. Officials said that with the uncertainty of the epidemic’s effect on economies it was impossible to design any specific criteria. “This is largely about language,” one official present at the talks said. “There is a broad understanding that in the short run conditionality should focus on health, and in the long run on the effort to return to a stable position. “This is broadly understood, but the language proved to be extremely difficult to agree,” said the official. The credit lines from the euro zone’s European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout fund could provide cash of up to 2% of a country’s GDP or 240 billion euros in total for the euro zone. The ministers did agree to give the European Investment Bank guarantees that would boost its lending by an additional 200 billion euros, as a measure to prop up companies. And they were in support of a European Commission proposal that the EU borrow 100 billion euros on the market to subsidise wages of individuals so that companies can cut working hours, not jobs. Separately, there was broad agreement among the ministers that the EU would need a recovery fund to help the euro zone economy rebound from the recession, which in Germany alone will have shrink output by 9.8% in the second quarter. But the ministers steered clear away from going into any detail of how such a recovery fund should be funded because such a discussion involved the highly contentious issue of whether the EU should jointly issue debt for that purpose. Mutualised debt is a red line for the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Austria, while Italy, France, Spain and several other countries believe that the extraordinary challenge of the pandemic calls for such extraordinary steps. Paolo Gentiloni, the Economics Commissioner, argued this week that joint debt issuance would give all countries equal chances to recover - as they would all borrow at the same low rate - rather than deepen already existing economic divergences and in this way fuelling eurosceptic and nationalist sentiment. But rather than creating a separate fund, officials hint that the recovery money could be linked to the EU budget. The EU Commission could borrow on the market for the whole of the EU against a suitably increased long-term EU budget now under negotiation, and then lend on to individual governments, additionally boosting the resources through leveraging. To support economies burdened by coronavirus lockdowns, the EU has already suspended limits on state aid and allowed member states to inflate their debt to spend more.

"6","Tesco defends dividend payout as warns coronavirus costs could top $1 billion","James Davey","Business News","LONDON (Reuters) - Tesco (TSCO.L) has defended its decision to pay investors a 635 million pound ($782 million) dividend while accepting business tax relief from the British government aimed at helping distressed retailers through the coronavirus crisis. Britain’s biggest retailer, which saw sales soar 30% in the three weeks before the country went into lockdown to contain the spread of the virus, estimated a hit of up to 925 million pounds from the costs of dealing with the pandemic and warned it couldn’t give profit guidance for the current financial year. But it said on Wednesday that if trading returned to normal by August, it was likely the extra expenses for its retail operations - mainly staff, store and distribution costs - would be offset by higher food sales and 585 million pounds of business rates relief from the government. CEO Dave Lewis said Tesco “thought long and hard about our responsibilities” and decided it was justified in paying a 6.5 pence final dividend to shareholders, while being in receipt of taxpayers’ money. He said investors, both large and small, relied on the dividend income, which was for the year ended Feb. 29, and so pre-dating the crisis. “What the government has done is recognise there were going to be incredible additional costs to keep feeding the nation,” Lewis told reporters. “Every pound we receive in rates relief will be invested in ensuring that Tesco is able to support Britain’s shoppers through this crisis period.” He said where Tesco didn’t need help from the government it wouldn’t use it, pointing out it had not deferred VAT (sales tax) payments in the way the government has allowed. The group also warned Tesco Bank would likely dip to a loss in its 2020-21 financial year, hurt by bad debts and a reduction in income from credit cards, loans and travel money. Tesco shares were down 4.7% at 1050 GMT, extending 2020 losses to 16%. With some other retail businesses, such as department store group Debenhams, in dire straits, Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne was reassured there were “no doomsday concerns playing out” at Tesco, with the health crisis having a “neutral impact on retail, but a one-year hit in banking profits.” Britain’s supermarkets saw a surge in demand as shoppers stocked up on essential goods such as pasta and toilet rolls ahead of the lockdown. Industry data last week showed UK grocery sales leapt more than a fifth to a record 10.8 billion pounds in the four weeks to March 22. However, the crisis has also caused higher costs, such as the implementation of social distancing measures that restrict the number of shoppers in store at any one time, expanding online delivery operations, hiring more employees and bonuses. Tesco’s wholesale business Booker has also been hit by the closure of hotels, pubs, restaurants and cafes, as have sales for general merchandise, clothing and fuel - the latter two down 70% over the last couple of weeks. Lewis said the panic buying that emptied store shelves and strained supply chains at the start of the crisis had subsided, and that he did not expect Easter trading to see the same peak as previous years. Tesco estimated extra costs related to the pandemic could be between 650 million and 925 million pounds, with up to 580 million due to additional payroll costs. It said that in the last two weeks alone it had recruited more than 45,000 workers in Britain to help cover staff sickness and cope with additional demand. The company currently has around 50,000 employees absent due to virus. It employs around 320,000 people in Britain. Tesco, which has about 3,800 stores in the UK and Ireland and a UK grocery market share of 27%, said operating profit before one-off items rose 14% to 2.96 billion pounds in its 2019-20 financial year, meeting forecasts. Despite the pandemic, Lewis said Tesco still expected to complete the 8.2 billion pounds sale of its Asian business in the second half of the year. And he still plans to leave Tesco on Oct. 1 after six years in the job, handing over to Ken Murphy, formerly of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O).

"8","WTO sees 'ugly' trade plunge, likely worse than financial crisis","Philip Blenkinsop","Business News","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization on Wednesday forecast that goods trade would shrink more steeply this year than in the global financial crisis a decade ago before rebounding in 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes - if countries worked together. The WTO said global trade would fall this year by between 13% and 32%, giving a wide range because so much about the economic impact of the health crisis was uncertain. “These numbers are ugly – there is no getting around that,” WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo said in a statement. “But a rapid, vigorous rebound is possible. Decisions taken now will determine the future shape of the recovery and global growth prospects.” Keeping markets open and predictable, he said, would be critical to spurring renewed investment. Countries working together would see a faster recovery than if each country acted alone. The Geneva-based WTO said that for 2021 it was forecasting a rebound in global goods trade of between 21% and 24%, depending largely on the duration of the coronavirus outbreak and the effectiveness of policy responses. The WTO also confirmed that 2019 had ended on a sombre note, with a 0.1% decline in goods trade, weighed down by trade tensions, notably between the United States and China, and an economic slowdown. In October, the WTO forecast trade growth would grow 2.7% in 2020 after expanding 1.2% in 2019. It said that this year, nearly all regions would suffer double-digit percentage declines in trade, with exports from North America and Asia the hardest hit. Sectors with complex value chains, such as electronics and automotive products, would also see steeper falls. Services are not included in the WTO’s forecast, but the WTO said trade in this area may be hit hardest by COVID-19 because of transport and travel restrictions.

U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, in a statement, said Congress would then have to work on passing another measure aimed at further expanding relief after the interim emergency funding bill passed. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the request for additional aid for small companies on Tuesday amid overwhelming demand for federal small business loans as stores shuttered and Americans sheltered at home in an effort to quell the spread of the fast-spreading disease. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican who initially had been skeptical of the need for more U.S. funding, on Tuesday said he would seek to pass the additional funds on Thursday. Pelosi, who leads the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, and Schumer said $125 billion of the $250 billion in small business aid must be allocated to community banks that serve farmers and nonprofit organizations as well as minority, women and veteran-owned companies. The bill must also include $100 billion for hospitals and other health care facilities, $150 billion for U.S. states and local governments, and a 15% increase for federal nutrition program benefits, they said. A follow up measure must then be tackled to “provide transformational relief as the American people weather this assault on their lives and livelihoods,” Pelosi and Schumer wrote.

Cyclone Harold, its strength ranked in the highest category of five, passed over Fiji’s south at about midday, levelling homes and snapping communications links in the archipelago, which has adopted curbs on movement to rein in the virus. “We’ve seen reports of injuries,” Vasiti Soko, the director of the National Disaster Management Office, said by telephone. “As to the number, as well as the intensity, of the injuries, that’s yet to be ascertained.” There were no immediate reports of deaths, but about 10 houses in Suva were reported destroyed, Soko added. Flooded streets, wild winds and ruined buildings on the country’s main island home to Suva featured in unverified video images and photographs circulated on social media. Emergency officials were scrambling to establish contact with the southern island of Kapavu, after the storm severed communications with it, Soko added. The ferocious storm has cut a path through the Pacific, which is already on high alert for an outbreak of the flu-like virus that has infected 1.4 million people globally and killed 82,000. Although Fiji has just 15 infections and no deaths, Prime  Minister Frank Bainimarama has banned unnecessary gatherings of more than 20 people, among other curbs. Bainimarama urged all Fijians to stay indoors unless told to evacuate. “Our evacuation centres are safe, they are sanitised and monitored to ensure they do not surpass capacity,” he said in In a social media posting on Wednesday. “Those under quarantine due to the threat of coronavirus will not mix with others.” The cyclone, which has killed dozens in the Solomon Islands before destroying buildings in Vanuatu, was expected to make its way to Tonga within days, weather forecasters said.

Thailand has closed its borders and banned entry to foreigners, except diplomats and work-permit holders to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. Those foreigners who entered the country before the ban was imposed - who had visas, received visas on arrival or under visa waiver programmes - will not need to line up at often crowded immigration centres around the country to extend their stay. The automatic visa extension has been granted until April 30, according to an interior ministry document. Police Lieutenant General Sompong Chingduang told Reuters the government could extend this deadline each month. Last week the government allowed migrant workers with expiring work permits to stay in the country, without the need to apply for extensions, until Thailand reopen its borders. The country reported 111 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday. They included 42 Thais repatriated from Indonesia who had travelled South Sulawesi province for a religious gathering last month before the event was postponed. In total, Thailand has reported 2,369 cases of the novel coronavirus, and 30 deaths. It has declared a state of emergency until the end of the month and imposed a nationwide 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew.

The memo added that since the system was in widespread use among the ministry’s international partners, it was currently impossible to ban its use entirely and that in crises employees could use it on private machines for professional purposes. “Based on media reports and our own findings we have concluded that Zoom’s software has critical weaknesses and serious security and data protection problems,” read the memo cited by Handelsblatt. A government source confirmed the authenticity of the memo but clarified that there was no restriction on using the desktop version of Zoom via a fixed-line connection, although confidential conversations should not be held as the application lacks end-to-end encryption. Zoom’s daily users have exploded as the coronavirus pandemic has spread around the world, forcing millions of people to work from home while schools have switched to its online app to hold classes online. The increase in usage has also exposed security flaws, including a phenomenon called ‘zoombombing’ in which malefactors gatecrash videocalls, seize control of shared screens and post offensive content. Taiwan’s cabinet has told government agencies to stop using Zoom’s conferencing app and other countries are considering a similar move, sources say.

The coordinated strategy comes after several EU countries have rolled out a variety of apps, triggering criticism from some data privacy activists who worry mass data collection could become permanent if not tightly controlled. European Commissioner for values and transparency, Vera Jourova, said a joint move to harness virus-fighting technology offered an efficient solution. “I fully support a European approach for the use of mobile applications and mobile data in response to the coronavirus pandemic in line with our fundamental rights. We will ensure this approach is transparent, proportional and based on people’s trust,” she said. The Commission said a fragmented and uncoordinated approach hampered the effectiveness of measures to tackle the pandemic and also caused serious harm to the region’s single market and to fundamental rights and freedoms. Describing it as a toolbox, the EU executive said the pan-European approach would include a common scheme for using anonymous, aggregated data to trace people who come into contact with those infected and to monitor those under quarantine. There will be a methodology to monitor and assess the  effectiveness of the mobile apps, their interoperability and cross-border implications, and whether they comply with security, privacy and data protection rules. To assuage privacy concerns, there will be a strict limit on the processing of personal data, which will be destroyed when the virus is under control, the Commission said. EU countries will work with the Commission and the European Data Protection Board to develop the principles by April 15.

"17","Trump removes top coronavirus watchdog, widens attack on inspectors general","Lisa Lambert, Makini Brice","Politics","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump removed the inspector general who was to oversee the government’s $2.3 trillion coronavirus response, a spokeswoman for the official’s office said on Tuesday, fueling concerns in Congress about oversight of the relief package. It was the Republican president’s most recent broadside against the federal watchdogs who seek to root out government waste, fraud and abuse following his removal on Friday of the intelligence community’s IG and his sharp criticism of the one who oversees the Department of Health and Human Services. Glenn Fine, acting Defense Department inspector general, was named last week to chair a committee acting as a sort of uber-watchdog over the federal government’s response to the new coronavirus, including health policy and the largest economic relief package in U.S. history. But Trump has since designated the Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general to be the new acting Pentagon IG, a spokeswoman said, meaning Fine is not eligible for the role overseeing the coronavirus package, known as the Cares Act. Politico first reported Fine’s ouster, saying he would  resume his post as the Pentagon’s principal deputy inspector general. Congressional Democrats said Fine’s removal, less than a week after his appointment, reinforced their determination to strictly oversee the massive spending package passed last month to prop up the economy as the country grapples with the disease. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it “part of a disturbing pattern of retaliation” by Trump. “We will continue to exercise our oversight to ensure that this historic investment of taxpayer dollars is being used wisely and efficiently,” she said in a statement. Trump largely shrugged off a question about Fine’s removal, saying it was his prerogative, that he had recently nominated a number of people to serve as agency IGs and suggesting he was removing those appointed under his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. “We have a lot of IGs in from the Obama era. And, as you know, it’s a presidential decision,” Trump told reporters. The fiscal stimulus bill is unleashing a flood of money for families and businesses, and has created three watchdog groups consisting of federal officials and lawmakers. Pelosi announced a fourth oversight body, a select House committee, last week. On Friday, the White House said Trump intended to nominate Jason Abend, a senior policy adviser at the Customs and Border Protection office, to be inspector general at the Pentagon. It also said Trump planned to nominate Brian Miller, a White House lawyer and former General Services Administration IG, to be special inspector general for pandemic recovery, responsible for overseeing the Treasury Department’s handling of funds.

"18","White House looks to bolster small business lending program","Pete Schroeder","Politics","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House hopes Congress will nearly double the size of its program to support ailing small businesses by the end of the week, as some of the nation’s largest lenders still sit on the sidelines and others remain unable to access the system. U.S. President Donald Trump said the administration will seek another $250 billion on top of the $350 billion of funds granted by Congress last month which launched on Friday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he hoped Congress would sign off on the funds by Friday, as small businesses scramble for the first-come, first-serve lifeline. “We want to make sure that every single small business can participate. We want to assure the workers that if you don’t get the loan this week, there will be plenty of money for you next week,” he said during a White House call with bank CEOs. Executives at Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase said they had received hundreds of thousands of applications. But as of Tuesday, Citigroup Inc (C.N) said it was only accepting a limited number of applications, while Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which has capped lending under the program at $10 billion, said it had yet to distribute any funds to clients. The SBA has also yet to launch a promised online system for taking on lenders that have never previously registered with the agency, according to the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA). “That’s an issue if you’re a non-SBA lender, which is more than half of the lenders out there,” said Paul Merski, an executive vice president at the ICBA. A representative for the SBA did not respond to a request for comment, but on Monday the agency defended its progress, saying the program was unprecedented and pointing out that it had authorized billions in loans in a very short time. Launched on Friday as part of a $2.3 trillion congressionally approved economic relief package to combat the disruption caused by the novel coronavirus, the program got off to a rocky start as the administration rushed to get funds out the door in days without establishing key terms and paperwork. Speed is critical, since half of small businesses have less than a two-week cash capital buffer. But the resulting confusion, bottlenecks and technology glitches have sparked widespread frustrations among bankers and businesses alike and left the U.S. Treasury and the SBA scrambling to fix the problems on the fly. “You couldn’t have scripted a better #trainwreck for our nations community banks and the small biz customers we serve!” Brad Bolton, president and chief executive of Community Spirit Bank in Alabama, tweeted on Monday night. The SBA overnight authorized 30 loans out of hundreds Bank of the West [BNP.UL] has been trying to process, Cynthia Blankenship, who runs the lender’s operation in Grapevine, Texas, told Reuters. “We are continuing to be inundated with requests,” she said, adding that many of those are from companies turned away by their big lenders, including Wells Fargo, which has said it is constrained by a regulatory cap on its balance sheet. Multiple small business owners took to Twitter over the past 24 hours to flag a document they had received from Wells, one of the biggest small business lenders in the country, advising potential applicants to reach out to other banks “to improve your chances of receiving a loan before the funds run out.” Prominent lawmakers including Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey and Chris Van Hollen also jumped into the fray on Tuesday, raising worries that less savvy small businesses without existing bank lending relationships will be shut out of the program altogether. Quickly deepening the program’s pockets could help ease small business worries that they may miss out, said officials. “We want to make sure there’s a geographic dispersion to all areas of the program,” said the ICBA’s Merski.

"19","Trump administration seeks $250 billion more in aid for small U.S. businesses: Mnuchin","Richard Cowan, David Lawder","Politics","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday asked Congress for an additional $250 billion in emergency economic aid for small U.S. businesses reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pushed for passage as soon as Thursday. In a posting on Twitter, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he had consulted with congressional leaders on the need for the second round of funding. If approved by Congress, the aid would add to the $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses enacted on March 27 as part of a $2.3 trillion economic stimulus in response to the virus outbreak. Shortly before Mnuchin’s announcement, McConnell, a Republican, said in a statement: “It is quickly becoming clear that Congress will need to provide more funding or this crucial program may run dry.” He added that he would work with Mnuchin and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on the initiative with the goal of winning Senate approval on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the top two Democrats in Congress, Schumer and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, would embrace this timetable as they have been pushing for a broader set of measures that would comprise a fourth coronavirus-response bill since early March. Quick Senate action would highlight the alarm over the crisis for small enterprises that have been shuttered because of the coronavirus outbreak. McConnell’s backing also marked a change in attitude. He warned in an April 1 interview with the Washington Post that Pelosi should not undertake a “premature” fourth stimulus bill related to the pandemic. But just days into the launch of the small business loans, with coronavirus cases raging in many parts of the United States, pressure built for more aid. “There is a critical need to supplement the (loan) fund to ensure America’s more than 30 million small businesses will be able to access this critical lifeline,” Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio said in a statement. Restaurants and hotels are among businesses hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with many of them shuttered. The loan program aims to encourage small enterprises to keep their employees on staff and to help them pay rent, mortgages, utilities and other overhead costs. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats were crafting a series of additional measures they plan to push in coming weeks. Democratic senators on Tuesday called for up to $25,000 in temporary, federally paid bonuses to medical workers and others in essential services, such as pharmacists, grocery store workers and truckers whose jobs put them at greater risk of coronavirus infection. Their plan also contained $15,000 incentives to help recruit first responders and health and home-care workers. Pelosi on Monday consulted with rank-and-file members of her Democratic majority about House committees working on a bill that could top $1 trillion to augment the $2.3 trillion measure enacted last month. A House Democratic aide on Tuesday said potential provisions include additional funding and greater flexibility for a “stabilization” fund helping state and local governments cope with the epidemic. The aide said legislation also would increase funding for federal agencies, such as the Labor Department and Small Business Administration which now must deal with an explosive growth in unemployment and loan programs, respectively. In an interview on CNN, Pelosi said she wanted to ensure that a range of financial institutions, including community and minority-owned banks, could participate in the loan program and that the lending did not just go to businesses that had existing relationships with lenders. Some small restaurant operators have voiced concerns the loan program was structured so that large companies and large franchisees could gain advantage.

"20","Germany tightens rules on foreign takeovers","","Deals","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s government agreed on Wednesday to tighten rules to protect domestic firms from unwanted takeovers by investors from non-European Union countries. The move comes at a time when Europe’s biggest economy, and the EU as a whole, is reconsidering relations with China in the face of increased investment in critical sectors by Chinese state-owned enterprises. In future, transactions which have implications for German security should be provisionally put on hold pending a final decision. In addition, a review of a potential deal can be undertaken if there is “likely harm” to the public system or security. Previously, an “actual danger” was needed. The security of EU partners should also be considered. “As the current situation shows, we in Germany and Europe need to have our own competencies and technologies in certain areas,” Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told reporters. The economy ministry also plans further measures requiring investors in artificial intelligence, robotics, semi-conductors, biotechnology and quantum technology to make public any purchases of 10% or more and allow Germany to screen them. Previously, only investments in areas such as energy, water, telecommunications and defence could be screened. German officials have described the Chinese takeover in 2016 of Bavarian robotics firm Kuka (KU2G.DE) as a wake-up call that underlined the need to shield strategic parts of the economy. An attempt by China’s State Grid in 2018 to buy a stake in power grid operator 50Hertz also focused German minds. After Berlin failed to find an alternative private investor in Europe, German state-owned bank KfW stepped in to keep the Chinese out. However, some companies in export-oriented Germany criticised the move, saying it sent the wrong signal, especially at this difficult time for the global economy. “Like no other country, Germany relies on open markets for exports and investments. How can we demand that of our trading partners if we seal ourselves off more?” said Carl Martin Welcker, president of the VDMA engineering association.

"21","Tiffany says Australian regulators seek more time to review LVMH deal","","Business News","(Reuters) - Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) said on Wednesday Australian regulators have sought more time to review LVMH’s (LVMH.PA) multi-billion dollar purchase of the U.S. jeweler due to the coronavirus outbreak, potentially delaying closure of the deal. The France-based owner of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton offered to buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion last November, and the deal is expected to close mid-2020. Tiffany said it still aimed to close the deal by that time, subject to the review by the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). The FIRB is experiencing delays in processing transactions and requested extending the statutory review deadline of April 8 to until Oct. 6, which LVMH has accepted, according to a regulatory filing www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/98246/000156459020015787/tif-8k_20200407.htm. The deal was cleared by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 26, while a draft filing has been submitted in Europe and pre-filing discussions are going on with the European Commission, Tiffany said. Tiffany’s shareholders approved the deal in February. Both LVMH and Tiffany have temporarily closed several outlets across the globe, including Tiffany’s iconic flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York, to curb the spread of the virus.

"22","Sabre wins court fight with Justice Department over Farelogix acquisition","","Deals","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has ruled that travel technology firm Sabre Corp (SABR.O) may purchase Farelogix after the Justice Department sued to stop the planned $360 million acquisition. Judge Leonard Stark of the U.S. District Court in Delaware said in a brief order on Tuesday that he had ruled for the defendant, which is to say the companies. The opinion was sealed. Sabre in a statement said it welcomed the decision and was waiting to hear from a British antitrust enforcer this week. “This federal court ruling supports our view that the Sabre-Farelogix acquisition is not anti-competitive. We appreciate the consideration the court gave to these important issues,” said Kristin Hays, a spokeswoman for Sabre. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its lawsuit filed in August 2019, the government had said that Sabre, the dominant provider of booking services in the United States with over 50% of airline bookings through travel agencies, “operated outdated technology and resisted innovation” while competitor Farelogix is “an innovative technology company that has stepped in to address the needs of airlines and their customers.” Reporting by Diane Bartz; editing by Jason Neely"
