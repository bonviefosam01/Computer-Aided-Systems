1,7-Apr-20,"Amazon to suspend delivery service competing with UPS, FedEx","(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> will suspend a delivery service that aims to compete with UPS <UPS.N> and FedEx <FDX.N> in the United States. The online retailer told customers that the service, Amazon Shipping, will be paused starting in June, according to the Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the change. Amazon is suspending the service because it needs people and capacity to handle a surge in its own customersâ€™ orders, the Journal reported, citing sources. ""We regularly look at a variety of factors across Amazon to make sure we're set up in the right way to best serve our customers,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Reuters in an email confirming the halt in service. Amazon Shipping is available in a handful of U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, and handles non-Amazon and Amazon marketplace packages. The company is grappling with a demand surge in the United States, where most residents are under stay-at-home orders to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus that is sweeping around the globe. Amazon has been unable to get many packages to customers in one or two days, as it had promised prior to the epidemic. The suspension of Amazon Shipping will allow the company to focus on its core delivery operation, said Trevor Outman, founder of consultancy Shipware. Amazon said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-amazon-com/amazon-to-hire-100000-workers-as-online-orders-surge-on-virus-worries-idUSKBN2133LB in March it would hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States to deal with a surge in online orders. UPS and FedEx shares rose 2% in extended trading on the news.

2,8-Apr-20,This is what I want my friends to do if they have COVID-19 symptoms and are asked to go to the emergency room,"   Ashita S. Batavia, MD, MSc, is a board-certified infectious diseases specialist and public health expert with extensive experience in treating epidemics. She works at Lawrence Hospital NYPH-Columbia.   _____ Nearly 400,000 Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19. In my state, New York, our hospital systems are being strained in unprecedented ways. As a frontline infectious diseases doctor, this is what I want my friends and neighbors to do if they have COVID-19 symptoms and are asked to go to the emergency room. If you think you have COVID-19 please call your primary care doctor. If you are having trouble breathing, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room Bring a list of all the medications that you routinely take, including the dose and the number of times you take it each day. Let us know if any of these medications were started in the last 3 months or if your dose was recently changed by your doctor. Unfortunately, we cannot quickly or easily access records from different hospital systems. Having this information on hand can save us valuable time.  Also, if you recently went to urgent care or another ER, please bring any records you were given. If you were prescribed medications, such as a Z-pack (azithromycin, an antibiotic), your doctor will ask how many pills you were able to take. If a doctor or nurse takes your medication list, please remember his or her name. Unfortunately, in a busy ER your list could be misplaced or forgotten in the pocket of someone’s white coat if they are pulled into an emergency. In addition to the name of the medication, it is important to know the reaction. For example, if you take Drug X, do you get a rash or have difficulty breathing? Some side effects, such as vomiting or loose stools, may be mistaken for an allergic reaction. If a drug that causes side effects could help you, the benefits may outweigh the risks. Your doctor will discuss this with you, and you should feel comfortable asking lots of questions. In New York, two major hospital systems have barred visitors unless a patient is giving birth. Being in a hospital can be unsettling, especially if you are alone. On my last shift, my patient, an elderly gentleman with COVID-19, wanted to tell his daughter that he was feeling better after getting oxygen and medications. He couldn’t call her because his phone battery died and he didn’t know her number. Locating a charger in a busy emergency room isn’t easy. Now more than ever, we want you to be able to reach your loved ones. Not to mention, your doctors need to know who they should call with updates on your condition or in the event of an emergency. I have seen that COVID-19 is an unpredictable and dangerous disease. In the hospital, patients that are doing well can suddenly deteriorate. It is important that we understand your wishes in the event of an emergency. Do you want to be resuscitated if your heart stops?  If you can’t breathe on your own, do you want to be intubated — put on a ventilator that will pump air into your lungs. This requires inserting a tube into your trachea, through your mouth. You will require sedation and will be unable to speak, and may be semi-conscious, for the duration of the procedure, which in the case of COVID-19 may be several days or even weeks. We advise patients to say either yes or no to both questions. If you choose to have everything done you are “full code.” The alternatives are “Do Not Resuscitate” (DNR) and “Do Not Intubate” (DNI). Every person is different, and medicine is not one-size-fits all. Your primary care doctor knows valuable information about your health. If your doctor asks you to go to the ER and you have one of these diseases, you can ask them for this information, and provide it to the doctors at the hospital. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): your baseline oxygen level, also called your O2 saturation. Hypertension: Your blood pressure on your medications. Or, if for whatever reason you do not take medications, your average blood pressure Kidney disease: On routine blood tests, your doctor checks your creatinine level to see how well your kidneys are functioning. If you get dialysis, it is important for us to know when you were last dialyzed. Heart disease: ideally, we would like a copy of your last ECG or echocardiogram report. Whether or not you have kidney disease, it helps us to know the creatinine level from your last blood test.   _____ Click here for the latest coronavirus news and updates.

3,7-Apr-20,Ex-Obama adviser Dr. Emanuel explains what it will take for America to 'return to full normalcy',"The U.S. reached a grim milestone on Monday, passing 10,000 coronavirus-related deaths, and according to a prominent physician, the nation won’t move beyond the crisis without a vaccine. “We're not going to get rid of this, or be past it, or return to full normalcy until that vaccine is available,” Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a former health policy adviser under President Barack Obama, told Yahoo Finance’s “The Ticker” on Monday. The good news is that Emanuel believes drug makers will come up with a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Pharmaceutical brands Inovio (INO), Moderna (MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) have all announced potential vaccines, with Inovio announcing on Monday that it was initiating the first phase of its clinical trial. But it could take at least a year for a vaccine to come to market, cautioned Emanuel, who serves as chair for the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. “I think an effective vaccine is likely,” Emanuel said. “If you talk to the companies that are doing the work, you know, just lay out the timeline to really assess a vaccine for its potential effectiveness, you might get, you know, tens of millions of doses a year from now.” “And for the general public, you might get a lot of doses available in Q3, Q4 2021,” Emanuel continued. “That's the timeline, and that's what people have to get into their head. And I think, for obvious reasons, politicians are resistant to that, and for, I think, the public hasn't heard it loud and clear despite it being said by public health experts over and over again.” Despite efforts to contain the virus through social distancing and other measures, over 1.3 million coronavirus cases have been reported worldwide, with numbers climbing higher each day. Last week, New York Times’ Motoko Rich reported that countries and cities across Asia were imposing stricter containment measures amid fears of a second wave of the novel coronavirus. “If you look at other countries... places like Hong Kong, South Korea. They have seen a resurgence when they've eased up, and that resurgence is what we're likely to see unless we have wide-scale immunity,” Emanuel said. “And I think that's what people have to understand.” Before that vaccine is available, Emanuel suggested, it’s crucial the U.S. doesn’t get ahead of itself and try to eliminate social distancing measures too quickly. Just Saturday, President Donald Trump said in a briefing, “We have to open our country again.” In his interview with Yahoo Finance, Emanuel acknowledged that it might be tempting to make America open for business again, with record numbers of Americans filing for unemployment as many businesses in the nation remain shuttered. “I really worry that what we're doing is having people, who really for obvious and good well-intentioned reasons, want the economy to open up rapidly, don't want businesses to fail, don't want, you know, what we're having — tens of millions of people unemployed,” Emanuel said. “But we need to be realistic about what is likely and possible given the nature of this virus,” he said. “And the fact that no people in December 2019 had any immunity to this thing and this thing is deadly.” Chelsea Lombardo is a production assistant for Yahoo Finance.

4,8-Apr-20,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures edge higher as investors eye pandemic developments,"Stock futures rose Wednesday morning after a volatile session the prior day. Investors continued to monitor coronavirus developments, and early reports that the government was beginning to consider exit plans to restart businesses closed due to the outbreak. At the session highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 rallied a total of more than 22% above its March 23 closing low, or 3.5% on the day, before ending the session slightly in the red. Investors this week have been tracking mixed to slightly more positive developments in the coronavirus pandemic, with hotspots including New York and Italy showing improving trends in new cases and hospitalizations, even as new deaths for the Empire State rose by the largest number since the outbreak began. Politicians in other virus-stricken regions were less upbeat, however, with the France’s health minister warning Tuesday the country had not yet hit its peak in the outbreak. Improving coronavirus case data and momentary risk rally aside, many analysts maintain that it would be premature to assume volatility will calm in the markets in the very near-term. “It is way too soon to signal an all-clear for the markets.,” Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, said in an email Tuesday. “First, as the news on the health front gets better, the news on the economic front will likely get much worse.” Eight out of 10 U.S. counties are under some form of lockdown order amid the pandemic, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/Moody’s Analytics study, with the bulk of those seeing billions of dollars worth of lost output daily as businesses stay shuttered. And the impact of these shutdowns will soon be reflected in economic reports released in the coming weeks. “April’s economic data will be a tough pill to swallow with monthly GDP [gross domestic product] likely contracting 50% at an annual rate,” Dutta said. “Next week, we get March retail sales and a couple of regional PMIs for April.” He added that when social distancing measures do eventually ease, ultimately, “‘opening up’ the economy sounds much easier in theory than it will be in practice.” “It is not a switch, but a process,” he said. Still, other prominent investors noted that the time of extreme panic may be in the past at this point, creating an opportunity for less drastically defensive positioning for market participants. “Investors who favored defense over offense have experienced smaller losses this year, have the satisfaction that comes from relative outperformance, and are able to spend more of their time looking for bargains than dealing with legacy problems,” Howard Marks, co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, wrote in a letter to clients Tuesday. “Thus, I feel it’s a time when previously cautious investors can reduce their overemphasis on defense and begin to move toward a more neutral position or even toward offense (depending on how sure they want to be of grasping early opportunities.” “I’m not saying the outlook is positive,” he added. “I’m saying conditions have changed such that caution is no longer as imperative.” — Dow component McDonald’s said its first-quarter comparable sales fell 3.4% over last year for the quarter ended March 31, as a steep drop in March sales dragged down results over the first two months of the period. Consensus analysts expected McDonald’s to report a 0.91% same-store sales drop for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data, although these estimates may not reflect the full impact of the recent escalation in the coronavirus outbreak. In the U.S., same-store sales dropped 13.4% in March after rising 8.1% for the two months ended February 29, leading to a net 0.1% rise in same-store sales for the full quarter. In the same quarter last year, comp sales rose 4.5%. For McDonald’s international operated markets, same-store sales dropped off even more steeply in March relative to the start of the quarter. Same-store sales dropped 34.7% after rising 8.5% in the two months ended February 29, leading to a net 6.9% drop for the full first quarter. McDonald’s withdrew its outlook for 2020 amid coronavirus-related uncertainty. “While the disruption means our business is faced with immediate challenges, we believe our agility has positioned us well to adapt and continue to serve customers where it is safe to do so,” CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement. “Approximately 75% of our restaurants around the world are operational, the majority of which have adapted to focus on Drive-thru, Delivery, and/or Take-away.” Shares of McDonald’s fell about 0.5% in early trading to $174.58 each. — Stock futures added to gains with an hour to go until the opening bell. Each of the three major indices was at least 1.2% higher, with contracts on the Nasdaq outperforming at a 1.33% gain. Pre-market gains in shares of Boeing led Dow futures higher. Meanwhile, travel and leisure names including Royal Caribbean, Norwegian Cruise Lines and American Airlines led early gains in the S&P 500, paring some of this year’s steep declines amid the outbreak. — Here were the main moves in markets, as of 7:18 a.m. ET: S&P 500 futures (ES=F): up 14 points, or 0.53% to 2,656.00 Dow futures (YM=F): up 120 points, or 0.53% to 22,611.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): up 55.5 points, or 0.69% to 8,067.50 Crude (CL=F): +$0.82 (+3.47%) to $24.45 a barrel Gold (GC=F): -$1.10 (-0.07%) to $1,682.60 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +1.1 bps to yield 0.745% — An index of mortgage loan applications fell 17.9% for the week ended April 3 from the prior week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s weekly survey. Within this headline index, the subindex tracking refinances fell 19% versus the prior week, but was still 144% higher than the comparable week a year ago as interest rates broadly came down. Purchases, however, fell both relative to the prior week and comparable period last year. The subindex dropped 12% from the previous week and was 33% lower than the same week last year. “Mortgage applications fell last week, as economic weakness and the surge in unemployment continues to weigh heavily on the housing market. Purchase activity declined again, with the index dropping to its lowest level since 2015 and now down 33 percent compared to a year ago,” Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement. “With much less liquidity and tighter credit in the jumbo market, average loan sizes declined, and mortgage rates for jumbo loans increased to a high last seen in January,” Kan added. — Here were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:02 p.m. ET on Tuesday: S&P 500 futures (ES=F): down 1.25 points, or 0.05% to 2,640.75 Dow futures (YM=F): down 18 points, or 0.08% to 22,473.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): down 5.75 points, or 0.07% to 8,006.25 — Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and reddit.

5,8-Apr-20,Doctors rethinking coronavirus: Are we using ventilators the wrong way?,"   Across the country, hospital administrators, doctors and public officials are pleading for ventilators, as the spread of coronavirus is making growing numbers of patients dependent on the machines that pump oxygen into their lungs to keep them alive. The subject comes up at almost every White House briefing on coronavirus, and the administration has even proposed an emergency effort to retool automobile factories to make more of the devices. In New York, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., Gov. Andrew Cuomo has largely focused his energy on efforts to bolster the state’s dwindling stockpile of ventilators, while officials in a number of other states have begun developing or updating guidelines for how to ration ventilators in the event of a shortage. But while hospitals and health care workers grapple with the grim reality that they may soon be forced to deny potentially life-saving treatments to certain patients due to a lack of supplies, some doctors are raising questions about how ventilators are currently being used on coronavirus patients — and whether they may actually be doing more harm than good. Early reporting on coronavirus deaths from China, Italy and the U.S. show that more than half — and as many as two-thirds — of COVID-19 patients who are placed on ventilators don’t survive.  “What we’re doing now is not working, and I think making the same mistake over and over is a sign of stupidity,” Dr. Paul Marik told Yahoo News. “If it’s not working, we’ve got to look for something else.” Marik is promoting a treatment of his own devising, a combination of corticosteroids and high-dose ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, as a first-line therapy for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Marik is a respected clinician, chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School. The protocol is controversial and untested, but the theory behind it illuminates a growing shift in thinking about the disease that may have important implications for how it is treated. Marik’s theory is based on an idea that is becoming widespread among researchers: that the cause of death for a significant number of COVID-19 patients, especially younger ones, is severe inflammation of the lungs resulting from an overly vigorous immune-system response. By administering anti-inflammatory drugs early and regularly after a patient is admitted to the emergency room, Marik believes he can prevent this complication, known as a “cytokine storm.” In those cases, “it’s not the virus that’s killing the host, it’s the host’s response to the virus,” said Marik. Coronavirus is highly contagious and can cause fatal disease in some patients, but immune reactions to the infection varies dramatically from person to person.  “People who are doing fine don’t need steroids, it’s the people who get sick from the storm,” Marik said. “Corticosteroids are really effective in downregulating that storm.” Marik has been touting the anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin C and steroids since 2017, when he first released the results of a somewhat controversial study claiming that intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine are an effective treatment for sepsis. The treatment failed in a larger study whose results were published in January, but he believes it may still hold promise for COVID-19. Marik’s protocol is untested, and his advocacy of vitamin C is very much a minority view. It is absolutely not something people can or should try for themselves; the corticosteroids are administered intravenously. One doctor who has been treating COVID-19 patients at a New York-area hospital says there’s no reason to believe it would work. Marik acknowledged that the World Health Organization has advised against the use of corticosteroids to treat viral pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 (except in clinical trials) citing previous studies on other viral diseases like SARS and MERS, which found insufficient evidence that the drugs were effective.  But Marik’s view encapsulates a growing suspicion among doctors treating COVID-19 that the disease has some novel features that may require a unique approach.   In addition to early anti-inflammatory treatment, the protocol followed by Marik and his colleagues includes alternatives to using a ventilator, a machine that delivers oxygen under pressure directly into the trachea by means of a tube inserted through the mouth. This requires deep sedation and prevents the patient from talking. He favors a technique called high-flow nasal cannula therapy, which delivers humidified and heated oxygen through nostril tubes, a less invasive procedure than intubation, and suggests positioning the patient on the stomach to improve oxygenation.  The goal is to delay, or avoid entirely, the need for the patient to go on a ventilator.  “Plenty of patients will need to go on a ventilator, you can’t help it, but you want to do whatever you can to prevent [that],” said Marik, adding that “fewer patients that go on ventilators, frees up [more] for those who really need them.” For those who need to be intubated, however, Marik and his colleagues are also recommending a different, gentler approach than the high-pressure ventilator settings typically used for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which Marik and others believe may actually be causing damage to the lungs of patients with COVID-19.  “It’s becoming a vicious cycle,” said Marik. “The ventilator is causing lung injury, which causes them to stay on the ventilator longer, and basically is depleting the supply of ventilators for people who need them.” Marik and his colleagues are not the only ones who believe a new approach may be needed to treat this new disease.  While health care providers in the U.S. have been able to glean some insights about the coronavirus from the earlier experiences of doctors in China and Italy, there is much about this completely new disease that remains unknown. As a result, doctors have been forced to treat patients for an illness they don’t fully understand, relying on conventional wisdom in scenarios that have proven thoroughly unconventional.  One example of this, some doctors argue, is the use of ventilators for coronavirus patients.  In a video posted to YouTube on March 31, which has been widely circulated and discussed among doctors on the front lines of fighting COVID-19, Cameron Kyle-Sidell, an emergency medicine doctor at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, explains how, like most health care workers around the U.S., when he first started providing critical care for coronavirus patients in March, he was under the impression that he would be treating patients with a “viral pneumonia infection that would progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome.” It’s based on this understanding, he explained, that doctors in New York and elsewhere have been using ventilators to treat coronavirus patients who suddenly become unable to breath on their own, in the same way that they would treat respiratory failure in people with ARDS.  However, over the course of nine days, Kyle-Sidell says he concluded that the lung disease developing in patients with COVID-19 was nothing like the typical presentation of ARDS. “COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see, is not a pneumonia and should not be treated as one,” said Kyle-Sidell. “Rather, it appears as if some kind of viral-induced disease most resembling high altitude sickness. It is as if tens of thousands of my fellow New Yorkers are on a plane at 30,000 feet and the cabin pressure is slowly being let out. These patients are slowly being starved of oxygen.” He now believes the treatment method being widely adopted for those suffering from coronavirus-induced lung disease is based on “a false paradigm.” “I fear,” he said, that using ventilators “to increase pressure on the lungs in order to open them up, is actually doing more harm than good, and that the pressure we are providing to lungs, we may be providing to lungs that cannot take it, and that the ARDS that we are seeing may be nothing more than lung injury caused by the ventilator.” “COVID-positive patients need oxygen, they do not need pressure,” he argued. “They will need ventilators, but they must be programmed differently.” Kyle-Sidell could not be reached by Yahoo News, but he reiterated his observations and concerns in an interview with John Whyte, the chief medical officer at WebMD, published on the medical news site MedScape on Monday.   Other doctors in the U.S. and Italy have made similar observations about the difference between typical ARDS and loss of oxygen that appears to develop rapidly in COVID-19 patients.  On March 30, the American Thoracic Society published a report titled “Covid-19 Does Not Lead to a ‘Typical’ Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,” based on the findings of three physicians treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure at an intensive care unit in northern Italy. The authors note that “while the clinical approach to these patients is the one typically applied to severe ARDS, namely high Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) and prone positioning,” patients with COVID-19 pneumonia present an atypical form of ARDS. Specifically, they observed a wide disparity between these patients’ “relatively well preserved lung mechanics and the severity of hypoxemia” or low levels of oxygen.  The authors of the report concluded that “all we can do ventilating these patients is ‘buying time’ with minimum additional damage: the lowest possible PEEP [a measure of air pressure within the lungs] and gentle ventilation. We need to be patient.” “It’s a basic concept of medicine: You treat patients based on the disease they have, not for disease you think they have or the disease you want them to have,” said Marik, expressing frustration that top health officials in the U.S. have not responded to his own calls to consider a different approach to treating patients with COVID-19.  “It pains me to see all of these patients dying and I know they don’t have to die,” he said.  While doctors like Marik and Kyle-Sidell are pushing to change the way ventilators are used to treat coronavirus, others are drawing attention to the possible long-term physical and neurological damage caused by the current method of treatment.  In a New York Times op-ed over the weekend, Dr. Kathryn Dreger, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at Georgetown University, urged coronavirus patients and their loved ones to consider the brutal and lasting toll ventilators can cause before they become “sick enough to need them.”  For many COVID-19 patients who, she explains, must be “put into a medically induced coma before being placed on a ventilator,” the treatment itself can cause significant damage to the heart, kidneys or brain that may be permanent, or even fatal. “Even among the Covid-19 patients who are ventilated and then discharged from the intensive care unit, some have died within days from heart damage,” wrote Dreger. For those who survive, “the amount of sedation needed for Covid-19 patients can cause profound complications, damaging muscles and nerves, making it hard for those who survive to walk, move or even think as well as they did before they became ill. Many spend most of their recovery time in a rehabilitation center, and older patients often never go home. They live out their days bed bound, at higher risk of recurrent infections, bed sores and trips back to the hospital.” Dreger clarified that she is not suggesting “we shouldn’t use ventilators to try to save people,” but rather that Americans should consider these facts and figure out out what they would want for themselves and their loved ones now, before it’s too late.  _____ Click here for the latest coronavirus news and updates.

7,7-Apr-20,'It doesn't make any sense:' Restaurant owners push back against SBA loan restrictions," Spencer Rubin has seen his restaurant locations dwindle from 20 to 2 in just one month.  The rapid closures brought on by the coronavirus pandemic have slashed 80% of his revenue, forced him to lay off roughly 100 full-time employees, as well as other painful cuts to The Melt Shop, a restaurant chain he built out over nine years. Still, Rubin hasn’t applied for a loan through the Small Business Association’s $350 billion program yet, because he’s not certain it will get his business back to where it would need to be. “That money will quickly come and go, and then you’ll kind of be back to where you are, if you don’t plan it out properly,” Rubin said. “If you just take that money and just pay people to be on payroll but there's no demand for them to work, there's no other money coming into the rest of the business to build up cash to then fund the next step of the business.” The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) allows small businesses to apply for loans up to 2.5 times their average monthly payroll. The funds are fully forgiven, so long as they are used for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. While payments can be deferred for six months, forgiveness is based on the employer maintaining or quickly rehiring its employees. The amount of forgiveness drops for companies that don’t follow all the requirements. “The challenge with the loan and the potential loan forgiveness is the 8-week window of time for spend, which may not work as intended for every business,” Rubin said. “Some restaurants will not see revenue above single digits of their pre-COVID steady state for some time. This will make it near impossible to rehire 100% of [full-time employees] which is the majority of the basis for the loan and loan forgiveness.” Rubin says his dilemma points to the limitations of the stimulus for restaurant owners. On Monday, the Independent Restaurant Coalition urged Congress to reconsider restrictions tied to the PPP. Among the requests by chefs: extending the loan period to three months, longer repayment windows, and an expansion of the total size of the program. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Union Hospitality Group Chairman and CEO Danny Meyer, echoed frustrations expressed by other restaurant owners. “The stimulus package tells us we’ll forgive your loans if you hire everybody back by June. Well, I can pretty much guarantee you that restaurants are not going to be back full force by June,” Meyer said. “Hopefully, we’ll see somebody come to their senses. And it’s just not realistic for our business.”    With more than a million restaurants across the U.S., the industry accounts for more than 15 million jobs in the country, according to the National Restaurant Association. Grim projections suggest a $225 billion loss stemming from the pandemic.  At Los Angeles-based pizza chain 800 Degrees Woodfired Kitchen, founder and chef Anthony Carron plans to apply for PPP, after laying off nearly 200 people. But, he’s not sure how many he can hire back. Prior to the virus outbreak, he operated 15 restaurants around the world. Now, he’s down to three locations in the U.S.  “It wouldn’t make any sense to take out a loan against something that is closed right now, because we just don’t know what’s going to happen when things bounce back,” Carron said. “It doesn’t make any sense to pay people to stand there to do nothing.” Meanwhile, he’s deployed his “hanging on strategy” to get through the next few months: upselling wherever he can through delivery. He’s added options for extra cheese, extra sauce, and started serving desserts and cocktails.  “We're pushing out payables, we're stretching everybody. We're negotiating landlords for reduced or no rent,” he said. Carron is confident current demand from deliveries will allow him to keep remaining employees on the payroll, but he’s less certain about the future of the restaurant industry. The dramatic changes brought on by the pandemic, may lead to permanent shifts that result in a significantly smaller footprint, he said. “It's no longer 100% full dining rooms anymore. It's a dramatically different risk calculus,” Carron said. “I think we've begun to see how this thing is going to affect the economy. I think it's just the tip of the iceberg.”  Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

What’s more, “coronavirus” was mentioned unaided by the teen respondents. Piper Sandler also noted that the earliest mention of “coronavirus” as a concern was on February 18, “much earlier than most Western governments.” The survey also found that teens are worried about the economy, with 47% indicating that they believe the economy is getting “worse,” up from 28% a year ago. “We saw a higher level of mentions around the ‘stock market’ and the ‘economy’ as top concerns,” the Piper Sandler researchers wrote. “One teen wrote in: ‘Restaurants are closing, I lost my job due to it.’” For the survey, Piper Sandler polled 5,200 teens with an average age of 16.2 years across 41 states between February 17 and March 27, “during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic.” The teens took the survey at home as part of their online learning, with schools closed due to the virus. Piper noted that it received lower responses in the Northeastern part of the U.S., where the virus has had the most significant impact. “We believe COVID-19 did impact that number of overall responses,” the Piper Sandler team wrote. The worried teens aren’t spending as much these days either. The teens reported that they’d spend $2,270 this year, the lowest level since the Fall of 2011. According to Piper Sandler, that implies teenage consumers between 13 and 19 will spend $63 billion in 2020. Some highlights from the quarantined teenagers include Instagram (FB) capturing the top spot as the social media platform they use the most, while newcomer TikTok debuted at the No. 3 spot. Snapchat (SNAP), however, remains the “favorite” social media platform. As for video streaming consumption, 33% said they’re watching Netflix (NFLX), down from 35% in Fall 2019 as newcomers Disney+ and AppleTV+ captured a share of 7% and 2%, respectively. According to the survey, 53% said Amazon (AMZN) is their favorite e-commerce site, up from 50% a year ago. - Julia La Roche is a Correspondent at Yahoo Finance.

9,8-Apr-20,A quirky post-crisis stock market trend has flipped: Morning Brief,"Wednesday, April 8, 2020 Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe In the coronavirus market, it seems like up is down and down is up. As we noted yesterday, earnings forecasts from Wall Street analysts have moved from just about the most uniform on record to the most disparate. The economy went from historically stable to facing the deepest recession on record. And even an oft-overlooked quirk in the market’s daily action has completely reversed the pattern that has endured for most of the last 30 years. In a note to clients over the weekend, analysts at Bespoke Investment Group observed that buying the market open in the SPY ETF (SPY) that tracks the S&P 500 and selling the close would’ve actually seen investors gain about 6% year-to-date (through Friday’s close). Buying the close and selling the open, in contrast, would see an investor down over 28%. On the surface, this might seem somewhat unremarkable. Many folks who follow markets closely will remember the “overnight futures gap down” headlines that seemed to come almost daily in mid-March. And so perhaps it is not a huge surprise that the data confirms most of the pain in this market is being inflicted by overnight futures trading and the resulting gaps at the next day’s open. That is what this period has felt like. But the bigger challenge this trend poses for investors is that it is the exact opposite of what has prevailed over the last few decades. “If we go all the way back to 1993 when SPY began trading, we see that all of SPY's gains over this time frame have come outside of regular trading hours,” Bespoke writes. “That is, if you bought SPY at the close every trading day and sold it at the next day's open, you'd currently be up 500%. If you did the opposite and instead bought SPY at the open every trading day and sold at the close, you'd actually be down 6.8%.” The overnight gaps in markets have long been an investor’s friend. This quirk in the S&P 500’s returns has been known for years. It is part of what informs the old market adage that dumb money sells the open and smart money buys the close. And that this trade is not only not working but in fact underperforming both the opposite strategy and the broader market shows just how much pressure consensus views of all sorts are coming under pressure in this environment. After a big rally in the final days of March, it seemed like a uniform view that stocks would eventually re-test their March 23 lows. And maybe they will. But from its recent low the S&P 500 is up over 20%. Bringing to mind another old market cliché that seems relevant right now — the goal of the market is to inflict as much pain on as many people as possible.

10,8-Apr-20,Wisconsin debacle spurs new calls to prepare for fall elections amid ongoing coronavirus pandemic," WASHINGTON — Images of Wisconsin voters standing in long lines, some for hours, to vote in Tuesday’s primary despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic prompted renewed calls by national Democrats to begin preparing now for the presidential election in the fall. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she will push in the next phase of emergency relief spending for “more resources for vote by mail, more same-day registration, more states sending ballots to those who are qualified to vote.” The $400 million for state elections officials included in the most recent relief package is “20 percent of what we actually need,” Pelosi said on CNN Tuesday. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., told Yahoo News that “what is happening in Wisconsin today is an outrage.” “I’m making the case to Republicans that no matter what party you choose, it is totally unacceptable to force mothers of infants or seniors to risk their health just to cast a ballot,” Wyden said in a statement. “Mail-in ballots are the safe option for voters. The alternative is the chaos we saw today,” he added. But multiple Republican Senate aides on Capitol Hill said that planning for the fall election is not on their radar right now, because their priority is dealing with more immediate concerns such as alleviating the economic impact of the virus and helping protect health care workers. One Republican Senate aide allowed that the scenes in Wisconsin — where roughly 7,000 poll workers refused to show up, requiring the presence of non-uniformed National Guard members to serve in their place — might spark more conversation in the GOP about how to plan for the fall election, if a second wave of coronavirus infections spreads across the country. Another said more federal funding for state elections officials is likely. However, President Trump and Republican leaders have shown outright hostility to increasing vote-by-mail capacity.   Trump has echoed a right-wing talking point that increasing mail-in voting would lead to fraud. “I think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting,” Trump said on Friday. “I think people should vote with voter ID. I think voter ID is very important, and the reason they don’t want voter ID is because they tend to cheat.” Trump’s comment overlooked the fact that in Wisconsin, absentee ballots are required to include a photocopy of a person’s identification card, and there has been no evidence of wide-scale or organized fraud involving mail-in votes. Trump repeated this sentiment on Tuesday. “The mail ballots are corrupt, in my opinion,” said Trump, even though he requested a mail-in ballot for himself in last month’s Florida primary. Trump advisers have expressed interest in sending a mail-in ballot to every voter over 65 but have opposed sending mail-in ballots to all voters. White voters over 65 are a reliable Republican voting bloc. The Republican National Committee on Tuesday said that “Democrats are attempting to use the coronavirus pandemic to achieve their far-left electioneering goals.” In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers supported moving forward with the election for some time, but then changed course over the past week and called on the Republican Legislature to postpone the election and move to an all-mail-in primary. Republicans refused, and when Evers pushed the election back Monday by executive order, he was overruled by the state Supreme Court, which is dominated by conservative-leaning judges. Yet it’s not clear that mail-in voting would give Democrats any kind of political advantage, despite the claim by Trump that expanding the number of people voting would make it harder for Republicans to win elections. Trump said that if voter participation were increased to levels that Democrats are pushing for, “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.” But in Maryland, where a Republican governor is considering holding the state’s June 2 primary with only mail-in ballots, Democratic leaders in the state Legislature have pleaded with him to retain in-person voting. “Minority voters are less likely to vote by mail, and ... transient and low-income populations are less likely to participate or even receive ballots,” the Democratic leaders said in a letter. In Wisconsin, Republican-leaning counties like Washington and Waukesha had higher rates of returned absentee ballots, at 80 percent and 76 percent, than did the largest Democratic-leaning counties Milwaukee and Dane, which returned mail-in ballots at rates of 61 percent and 68 percent, respectively. “You need to keep in-person voting options available,” Megan Lewis, co-founder of Voting Rights Lab, told Yahoo News. Lewis, who is also executive director of the voting rights group, said that mail-in voting is not ideal for multiple groups: rural voters, Native Americans, non-English speakers, disabled voters and racial minority groups who have an instinctive distrust of the postal system and often organize voting around church service. Myrna Perez, director of voting rights at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, said that the best approach to a fall election that takes place in the midst of a pandemic would be to expand access to voting by mail while also increasing polling places in some locations to reduce lines, waits and large gatherings. Perez said that Republicans would have to be part of the solution. “The big message is that we need politicians on both sides of the aisle to come together and make sure elections administrators have the resources they need to conduct safe and healthful elections,” Perez told Yahoo News in an interview. “We need a lot of options available to make sure voters are capable of casting a ballot without putting themselves at risk.” Perez also said that elections reforms made during an emergency need not be viewed as permanent. Modifying how the election is conducted “doesn’t mean that it is etched in stone forever. It can be revisited,” she said. “That is something we should be doing anyway. Our electoral systems should be dynamic. “We can design a system that strikes a balance between giving voters the access they need and keeping our elections secure,” Perez said. “And the desire and need to do both is something that I think all political angles could agree on.”  _____ Click here for the latest coronavirus news and updates.

12,7-Apr-20,"'We're in dire need': Food service shutdown slams dairy farmers, producers","Every day, Wisconsin dairy farmers Jim and Katie DiGangi watch more of their life’s work go to waste. “We’re definitely not sleeping well. It’s devastating,” said Katie DiGangi. The couple’s families have worked in agriculture for as long as they can remember. They say farming is their family’s passion and its legacy, but the COVID-19 crisis has put it all at risk. Darlington Ridge Farms produces about 30,000 gallons of milk every day—but it now dumps 12,000-15,000 gallons per day, because food-service demand has dried up. Restaurants, schools and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus no longer need the milk dairy farms produce. “Disposing of half of our product —that we have put our blood, sweat and tears into — is extremely heart-wrenching,” said Jim DiGangi in an interview with Yahoo Finance. As dairy farmers dump massive amounts of milk, warehouses are filling up with cheese that has no place to go. “We're talking about millions and millions of pounds of cheese that have not been sold because of lost and canceled orders from food service,” said John Umhoefer, executive director of the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association. Umhoefer told Yahoo Finance half of all cheese, butter and other dairy products in the United States go to the food-service industry. “There are whole companies in our industry that are dedicated to just serve the food-service industry — or 75% of their sales or 50% of their sales — and they are finding that all their orders are canceled in food service,” said Umhoefer. “It's unprecedented.” For the DiGangis, one of the most frustrating parts of the situation is that some demand still exists, but the industry can’t meet it. “Our local grocery stores 10 miles away are limiting butter, milk and cheese purchases and we're over here dumping our milk because the supply chain is not designed for what's happening,” said Katie DiGangi. “It’s not designed for everybody being at home. We're all cooking at home,” said Jim DiGangi. “So we have the product available. The supply chain — i.e., the processors, the bottlers — [doesn’t] have the tools and the packaging to meet the demands of the retailers.” Experts say it’s impossible to immediately shift products designed for restaurants to grocery stores. The recipes, the label requirements and the companies that pick up and deliver the products are all different. “To rebuild all that in a matter of weeks is not possible,” said Umhoefer. Paul Bauer is CEO of the Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery in Wisconsin, which is made up of about 300 dairy farms. The 110-year-old co-op has two manufacturing plants and a processed cheese plant. “If you're a blue cheese plant, you make blue cheese. If you're a cheddar manufacturer, you make cheddar,” said Bauer. “There is no way that you can take a mozzarella cheese or a blue cheese plant and suddenly convert them into bottling plants. It just doesn't work that way because they don't have the equipment to bottle it.” Eight members of the Wisconsin Congressional delegation wrote a letter to USDA, urging the agency to step in and help. Lawmakers want the federal government to buy cheese and dairy products for food banks around the country. “We need immediate action to keep the dairy supply chain moving and not waste the critical food our farmers and food processing workers are producing,” the lawmakers wrote. Among other things, the lawmakers want the government to place orders for dairy products on behalf of schools that can be fulfilled once they reopen, and use its emergency funding included in the CARES Act to expand the use of the Healthy Fluid Milk Incentives program — which aims to boost milk purchases by people who receive food assistance. “Dairy purchases will also help to keep dairy processing plants up and running, so that our manufacturers and their dedicated employees can continue their important work of providing food for our nation,” said the lawmakers. “In order for those plants to keep running, they need a market for their cheese, and in this extraordinary time, the federal government is uniquely able to purchase that cheese and make sure it reaches American dinner tables.” The industry has also made its case to USDA, asking for relief. “We need the USDA to step up and start getting forms of dairy products that might be a little bit out of the range of the average consumer— such as a five-pound loaf of processed cheese or mozzarella in larger chunks— so they can start distributing that,” said Bauer. “Because it's amazing the food insecurity that we have in this country.” “We need to get the food to the people that need the food and there needs to be some direct relief for farmers and the processors to mitigate the situation,” said Katie DiGangi. In a statement to Yahoo Finance, USDA said it is actively monitoring agriculture commodity markets during the coronavirus emergency. “The US food supply chain remains safe and secure and we are committed to ensuring America’s farmers, ranchers, and producers get through this pandemic. We are swiftly evaluating the authorities granted under the CARES Act and will leverage our programs to alleviate disruption as necessary,” said a spokesperson for USDA. Bauer said the coronavirus hit the dairy industry at a particularly painful time. The industry has struggled in recent years, in part because of turbulent international trade. “We were seeing some normalized trade, but this pandemic really has disrupted that — and we don't know how many farms are going to be able to make it out of this change,” he said. “The rate of decline will be dramatic as we go forward.” The DiGangis employ 35 people on the farm and say they haven’t laid anyone off, in part because they need to make sure their 2,700 cows stay healthy. The couple told Yahoo Finance they are in the process of applying for a small business loan through the Paycheck Protection Program, but they hope USDA will step in soon. “We’re in dire need, along with other small businesses,” said Jim DiGangi. “We're hemorrhaging cash like everybody else.” Jessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.

13,8-Apr-20,Coronavirus and shopping for supplies: Getting to the bottom of the toilet paper shortage,"On a recent Friday afternoon in western Iowa, a man was waiting in line to buy toilet paper at a local Dollar General store when another customer started giving the man grief about it, according to local police.   At issue was the amount of toilet paper being purchased. After feeling threatened by the other customer's aggressive behavior, the toilet paper buyer displayed a gun in self-defense. “It escalated almost to the point of a physical confrontation,” Atlantic Iowa police Lt. Devin Hogue told USA TODAY. In the end, neither person was injured, but the initial aggressor was charged this week with disorderly conduct, adding to the recent police blotter over bath tissue.  In Florida last month, sheriff’s deputies arrested a man for allegedly stealing 66 toilet paper rolls from a Marriott hotel. In California last week, Beverly Hills cops found 192 rolls of toilet paper in a stolen SUV. Need money help? We got you: Money advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here All are symptoms of the shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic – a supply shortfall caused by a surge in demand that goes beyond just panic buying and hoarding. Experts say empty store shelves also are caused by a fundamental shift in demand for a certain kind of toilet paper for use at home, as well as kinks in the supply chain between factories and stores. Yet there is hope: Two of the main ingredients used to make toilet paper – paper fiber and water – are in strong supply. Production is being ramped up at American factories operating 24-7. And experts expect a more abundant stock soon on store shelves. “I can’t give you an exact number, but I will tell you we’re making more than ever,” said Arist Mastorides, president of family care for Kimberly-Clark North America, maker of Cottonelle toilet paper and other paper products. “It’s a significant amount to cover what we think will be used with people traveling less and staying home more.” That’s part of the problem right now – not just hoarding and not because people are going to the bathroom more than normal. It’s also because so many consumers are going to bathroom in different locations from before the pandemic – at home instead of workplaces, which often use a different kind of toilet paper than used at home. One kind of bath tissue – for the commercial market – often is made of one ply of recycled fiber and generally is found on rollers at businesses and public places. The other kind – retail toilet paper – is often made of two-ply virgin fiber and is generally much softer for use at home. This location shift prompted by shelter-at-home rules would lead to an estimated 40% increase over the average daily home usage, according to Georgia-Pacific, which makes Quilted Northern toilet paper and other paper products. The demand has “increased on retail, and it’s staying steady or surged in the commercial market” because of use at busy healthcare facilities and other essential businesses, said Eric Abercrombie, spokesman for Georgia-Pacific based in Atlanta. Abercrombie said the company still expects commercial-market toilet paper demand to decline as “business and vacation plans change.” Meanwhile, retail toilet paper demand swelled to unforeseen heights in March, with $1.45 billion in toilet paper sales in the four-week period ending March 29, up 112% from a year earlier, according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. Retail stores couldn’t keep enough supply on the shelves, and the supply chain became strained by the demand. Bathroom supplies: Here are the places where you can still buy toilet paper Need toilet paper? Procter & Gamble plant goes into overdrive during coronavirus crisis The supply chain for toilet paper “is not built for dramatic shifts and seasonal demand changes,” said Scott Luton, the CEO and founder of Supply Chain Now, a digital media company. “It’s not like pumpkins during the fall and chicken wings during the Super Bowl.” Luton also notes that re-purposing commercial-market toilet paper to retail shelves “is not simple to do” even with stocks of it sitting untouched in storage rooms of closed businesses. Getting more product to market is another matter. Georgia-Pacific, for example, has 14 facilities in 11 states making toilet paper. Before it gets to retail store shelves, those packages might first go to a regional distribution center by truck. “We are working hard to maximize the number of deliveries we can load and ship out of our facilities – you can just load and unload so fast,” Abercrombie wrote in an e-mail. In the last week of March, “our mills and regional distribution centers managed to ship out 120% of normal capacity. We also are working with customers to have direct shipments when possible to reduce distribution time. We currently don’t have any issues with carrier capacity (trucks and trailers) to ship.” Normally, this is a well-timed process based on consistent demand for a product that does not take long to make in factories. For Kimberly-Clark, the fiber generally comes from trees in North or Latin America and then is transported to American factories in big white sheets. The material then gets dumped into bins with water, where it’s blended and formed into massive rolls to be cut into logs and then smaller individual rolls. “The whole process happens very, very fast,” said Mastorides, who declined to say exactly how long because of competitive reasons. The process also is highly automated. “So when there is a surge in demand, which we have never seen before, the toilet paper manufacturers cannot keep up,” said Patrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse. “They would love to be able to supply all the demand but they would need to expand capacity by buying more equipment. It's very expensive. So really all they can do to minimally increase their capacity is using overtime or maybe adding another shift if they can.” The biggest toilet paper makers in the U.S. say their factories are working 24-7 to produce record amounts, including Procter & Gamble, which makes Charmin and other paper products. All have the added challenge of keeping their workers healthy during the coronavirus outbreak. “We are prioritizing our bestselling sizes to maximize the amount of product we can ship to retailers,” said Loren Fanroy, a spokesperson for Procter & Gamble. Mastorides of Kimberly-Clark also said it is increasing production by minimizing the different kinds of packages it normally makes, such as four-packs, eight-packs and 24-packs. Some ships directly to retailers, others to distribution centers where it mixes it with other Kimberly-Clark products. “Our limited assortment is enabling us to get that product through and into our distribution centers faster, and as we work with our retail partners to get that limited assortment, they’re able to build trucks faster,” Mastorides said. Paper towels are manufactured in much the same way as toilet paper and by the same companies. But it is not flying off the shelves like toilet paper for a variety of reasons, even if cleaning supplies are at a  premium during the pandemic. One reason is that reusable cotton towels often are used instead. Another is that the fear of running out of an essential First World product – toilet paper – spreads through social media and other channels. “We’ve known for a long time it’s essential for a better life,” Mastorides said. “It’s something they’ve chosen to stock up on.” Retail customers soon are expected to get more relief as manufacturers increase production, home bathrooms run out of room for stockpiles and at least some commercial-market product is re-purposed to meet retail demand. “It’s really just trying to get that supply chain caught up,” said Abercrombie of Georgia-Pacific. “We took care of the demand we could in terms of existing inventory. We tried to increase operations where we could, and then also trying to smartly manage a distribution to get it out.” Follow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

14,7-Apr-20,"Releasing young people could be best way out of lockdown, experts suggest","Releasing young people aged between 20 and 30 years old who do not live at home with their parents could be the best route out of coronavirus lockdown in the UK, researchers have suggested. The strategy could help to balance the health risks associated with coronavirus and help the economy avoid an “extraordinary recession”, according to a new briefing paper by experts at the University of Warwick and Warwick Business School. The UK does not currently have an exit strategy for the coronavirus lockdown, implemented to protect people from the spread of the deadly virus. But as the crisis continues, the strain placed upon the economy worsens. Allowing the 4.2 million 20- to 30-year-olds in the UK who do not live with older people to resume their daily lives could get the economy moving again, while protecting older people who appear to be more susceptible to severe cases of the virus. Of those, 2.6 million are employed in the private sector and are more likely to lose their jobs or income during a lengthy lockdown. Releasing them to resume work would allow them to fulfil vital roles in the UK’s transport and delivery network, or open small businesses to stimulate the economy, according to the report. Read more: Workers under-25 and women financially worst hit by coronavirus Keeping half of young private sector workers from being made redundant could generate an additional £13bn ($16bn) a year for the economy, the researchers found. A separate study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that younger workers are likely to be hit the hardest by the lockdown, as they are nearly two-and-a-half times more likely to work in a shutdown area, with 30% of workers under the age of 25 employed in those sectors, compared with 13% of those aged 25 and over. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said: “The rationale for lockdown is to save lives in the short to medium term. “However, severe damage is being done to the economy, future incomes, unemployment rates, levels of national debt, and the freedoms we enjoy as a modern society. Before long, some balance will have to be struck.” Another reason for the early release of young people highlighted by the report is that this age group could become increasingly restless over time and are more likely to break the rules of the lockdown, creating a domino effect that undermines public safety. Read more: Travel and hospitality hardest hit as COVID-19 continues to ravage UK job market The report warns that the government would also have to communicate the rationale for the age restrictions clearly to older adults to minimise resentment and police officers would have to enforce them.  The research suggests that older adults could be released from lockdown through a strategy of staged release, using antibody testing to check that people had already recovered from coronavirus. The researchers also pointed out that young adults are statistically less likely to die from coronavirus or develop severe symptoms. However, unless a vaccine is found to completely eliminate the disease, the researchers calculated that this policy could result in an estimated 630 extra premature deaths. Nick Powdthavee, professor of behavioural economics at Warwick Business School, said: “We support the existing lockdown strategy, but in the future it will be necessary to allow citizens to go back to some kind of normal life. “Unless a vaccine is suddenly discovered there are no risk-free or painless ways forward. “If this policy were enacted, there would still be tragic cases and some pressure on the NHS, but the effects would be far smaller than if the wider population were released.

15,8-Apr-20,Trump adviser warned of millions of virus deaths in January. Trump says he saw the memo only this week.,"   President Trump said Tuesday that he did not learn of two memos written in January and February by his own economic adviser warning that a COVID-19 pandemic could kill as many as 2 million Americans until “maybe a day ago.” “I heard he wrote some memos talking about pandemic,” Trump said during a White House coronavirus task force briefing, “I didn’t see them. I didn’t look for them, either.” On Jan. 29, Peter Navarro warned his colleagues at the White House that if the administration did not mount an aggressive containment strategy for the coronavirus, it could kill more than half a million Americans and cost the country nearly $6 trillion. Nearly a month later, on Feb. 23, Navarro distributed an even more dire second memo in which he said as many as 100 million Americans could be infected with COVID-19, which might kill upwards of 2 million U.S. citizens. On Feb. 27, Trump briefed the country on the coronavirus outbreak, assuring Americans that it was well under control. “When you have 15 people,” Trump said of the number of reported cases in the U.S. at the time, “and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” Pressed on whether he had been apprised of Navarro’s warnings, the president said Tuesday he had not. “I asked him about it just a little while ago, because I read something about a memo,” Trump recalled. “I said, ‘Did you do a memo?’ I didn’t look for, I didn’t see it, I didn’t ask for him to show it to me.” Navarro has no medical background or national security brief; he is an economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy for the administration. On Monday, he got into a heated exchange with CNN anchor John Berman over his advocacy of the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, something Trump has also promoted. Navarro insisted to Berman that he was qualified to have an informed position. ""Doctors disagree about things all the time,” he said. “My qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I'm a social scientist. I have a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies.” For weeks, as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 steadily spread across the country, Trump has stood at the briefing podium and insisted the pandemic caused by the coronavirus, the “invisible enemy,” could not have been foreseen. “Nobody knew there would be a pandemic or epidemic of this proportion,” Trump said on March 19. But confronted with the existence of Navarro’s memos, the president shifted his explanation. “Nobody said, It’s going to happen, but there is a possibility, there always has been a possibility, but people wouldn’t talk about it,” Trump said. Asked when he first learned about Navarro’s warnings, Trump said “maybe a day ago, two days ago.” Their existence was first reported Monday by Axios. Trump has been criticized for repeatedly portraying the coronavirus outbreak as “under control,” and likening it to the common flu at a time when the virus was gaining a foothold in the U.S. On Tuesday, he sought to explain his rosy assessments of the pandemic that has brought American life to a grinding halt while infecting nearly 400,000 Americans and killing more than 13,000. “The cases really didn’t build up for a while, but you have to understand, I’m a cheerleader for this country. I don’t want to create havoc and shock and everything else, but ultimately when I was saying that I’m also closing [travel from China] down,” Trump said, adding, “I’m not going to go out and start screaming, This could happen, this could happen. So, again as president, I think a president has to be a cheerleader for their country.” Trump also said he had still not read Navarro’s memos. “I basically did what the memo said, which was a pretty good memo from the standpoint that he talked about, I guess, I didn’t see it yet.” _____ Click here for the latest coronavirus news and updates.

17,7-Apr-20,Your stimulus check is coming – Here are the do's and don'ts,"The Treasury Department and the IRS said last week that stimulus checks will be distributed in the next three weeks, deposited automatically for most people. A family of four could receive up to $3,400, depending on their income. The stimulus checks are intended to stimulate the economy, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should spend yours right away. Here are some things to consider: 1. If you are still working but don’t have a three-month emergency fund: Save your stimulus check. Now is the time to stop unnecessary spending and build your emergency fund. You should have money for at least three months of basic expenses (rent and food) in a high-yield savings account. If you don’t, deposit your stimulus check there. US DOUBLES INTEREST RATE ON SMALL BUSINESS LOANS AFTER LENDERS COMPLAIN 2. If you are still working and already have a three-month emergency fund: Now is a good time to spend. You can find great deals, support your favorite businesses, and help stimulate our nation’s economy. You may also be eligible for current low refinance rates for homes and auto loans. Now is the time to take advantage of these opportunities to lower your monthly loan payments or shorten your loan terms. EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WHO GETS A CORONAVIRUS RELIEF CHECK 3. If you are out of work: Use your stimulus check to cover basic essentials to help you live over the next few months. Remember that federal unemployment insurance will cover four months of your full salary – much higher coverage than ever. Also, consider filing your 2019 income taxes. The previous year, the average tax refund was $2,725 per filing. If you don’t need to spend your stimulus payment – even if you are out of work – don’t. Put it in your emergency fund in case your unemployment lasts longer than four months. 4. Defer loans if you can’t make all of your monthly payments. You can now defer payments on federal student loans, and many lenders are allowing borrowers to skip payments on mortgages, car loans, credit cards and other debt. Check with your lender to see if you qualify and what options are available to you. 5. Use this time at home to assess your financial situation. A quarter of Americans don't know their mortgage rate; nearly half haven’t checked their credit score recently; and one in five don’t know whether they have credit card debt. WHAT APPLICANTS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN PROGRAM A good financial assessment means knowing all of your debt and the interest rates you are paying. Pay off debt with the highest interest rate first. Keep in mind your highest-cost debt has the highest interest rate, not necessarily the highest payment. Then, budget all of your expenses in order of priority. 6. Consider a credit union. The number of Americans using credit unions grew during and after the 2008 recession. At the end of 2009, credit unions had 89.3 million members and $884.7 billion in assets; by 2019, they had 119.6 million members and $1.54 trillion in assets. The reason is that many banks were unwilling or unable to meet the needs of struggling consumers. Credit unions, as not-for-profit member-owned financial institutions, don’t answer to stockholders; instead, profits are reinvested back into the credit union to directly benefit members. So credit unions are often more willing and able to work with members having tough financial times. Full disclosure: I am president and CEO of PenFed Credit Union. 7. Stay positive – and wash your hands. Yes, the stock market is down, workers have been laid off, and many of our favorite places are closed. But this is also a great time to save and plan for your future. You can put yourself in a better financial position. And, now that we have a little extra time, remember to wash your hands for a full 20 seconds. Protect yourself physically as well as financially. James R. Schenck is president and CEO of PenFed Credit Union and CEO of the PenFed Foundation. PenFed is federally insured by NCUA. Equal Housing Lender.

18,7-Apr-20,President Trump has singled out these companies for their coronavirus response,"During his daily coronavirus task force briefings at the White House, President Trump has not shied away from calling out companies by name.  In one memorable example on March 30, he hosted five CEOs – including the heads of Procter & Gamble and Honeywell – who each touted their contributions to the coronavirus response from behind a Presidential seal. Trump has also harshly called out companies which, in his view, have failed to respond to the crisis. The president has mentioned somewhere around 100 companies in recent weeks while discussing the response. Here’s a list of companies that have gotten the most attention. No company has been in Trump’s sights more than 3M (with a possible exception of General Motors). On April 6, the president announced that he had come to a “very amicable agreement” with the company to produce millions of N-95 masks. The news came after the president invoked the Defense Production Act last week to compel the company to produce masks and also keep them in the United States. “We're very disappointed in 3M. They should be taking care of our country,” Trump said on April 4, adding, you “could call it retaliations because that's what it is, it's a retaliation.”    We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks. “P Act” all the way. Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay! And before that, Trump had first been friendly with the company. On March 28, he said, based on what he was hearing, 3M was doing “an incredible job.” On March 5, during the early stages of the administration’s response to the crisis, Vice President Mike Pence visited 3M headquarters in Minnesota to commend the company for its mask production. “The 3M saga ends very happily,” Trump said Monday summing up all the back and forth (for now). On March 13, Trump made a startling announcement. He said Google was helping to develop a website that was “going to be very quickly done” to provide a coronavirus screening site to help all Americans. “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now,” he said. The news apparently took Google’s parent company, Alphabet, by surprise. It quickly clarified that Verily, another division of the company, was indeed building a website, but they were “in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time."" Verily later did launch its site but, as of April 7, it remains available only to residents of four counties in California. Trump met with 12 Wall Street banking executives in early March at the White House to discuss the crisis. Since then, he hasn’t discussed these companies often during his public appearances, but recently singled out banks for praise after their implementation of the $349 billion Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses. On March 3, Bank of America became the first big bank to accept applications for the program. Other banks – like Citibank (C) – featured messages asking for patience with the program: ""While we are working as quickly as we can, we are not yet able to accept applications for the Paycheck Protection Program,” Citibank’s website read at the time.    I will immediately ask Congress for more money to support small businesses under the #PPPloan if the allocated money runs out. So far, way ahead of schedule. @BankofAmerica & community banks are rocking! @SBAgov @USTreasury “It's worked out incredibly well, and I want to thank Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and a lot of the big banks that have been involved,” Trump said Saturday even as glitches continue to lead to delays in many small businesses getting a needed cash infusion. On March 29, the president praised Boeing as one of the companies “repurposing factories” to produce personal protective equipment. They also, he noted, have been “giving us their cargo-moving planes.” The company has come up again and again. “Boeing, until a year ago, was the greatest company, I think, in the world by far” the President said on March 27. The company is widely expected to receive government assistance from the recently passed $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. Trump recently noted that “Boeing will probably need a hand, and we're going to bring Boeing back to health.” Other airline companies have also been promised relief: “we will be able to handle United, and we'll be able to handle Delta, and we'll be able to handle all of it,” Trump said. “We have plenty of money.” Two leading private medical testing companies have been mentioned multiple times from the White House podium. “We are grateful to LabCorp and Quest for taking up the charge immediately,” Dr. Deborah Birx, the Coronavirus Response Coordinator on the task force, said on March 13 as the U.S. began to ramp up testing. The CEOs of the two companies also appeared at the White House on March 13 alongside Trump to highlight how they have “come together as an industry” to provide more tests. Both companies are administering tests around the country and feeding the results to state governments and the CDC. Two coronavirus test companies have gotten special mention for their work developing coronavirus tests even as the U.S. has lagged behind other countries on overall testing capacity. This past Sunday, Trump again called Abbott Laboratories – which said its test can detect COVID-19 in as little as 5 minutes – a “great company.” “Roche has been incredible in the testing job they've done,” Trump said on March 30 pointing to another testing company. “And they're ramping it up exponentially, It's up, up, up, up.” Two other companies – Becton Dickinson (BDX) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) – have also gotten more limited White House shoutouts. The automaker has begun a partnership with General Motors to produce ventilators. “Ford has been great,” Trump said on March 31. He has spoken of Ford in glowing terms, in contrast to the treatment received by General Motors. “I've issued a challenge to those two companies à la ‘Ford v Ferrari’” President Trump recently said “let's see who gets those ventilators out first” The president said GE Healthcare, which committed to producing ventilators, “has been great.” He invoked the Defense Production Act not to punish the company but to help it and other manufacturers “have the supplies they need to produce ventilators.” The DPA action was intended to help GE and other smaller ventilator companies – namely Hill-Rom (HRC), Medtronic (MDT), ResMed (RMD), Royal Philips (PHG), Vyaire Medical – get the supplies they needed. In March, General Motors and Ventec Life Systems (a respiratory care company) teamed up to produce ventilators at a plant in Indiana. On March 27, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to make them move faster, saying that “GM was wasting time.”    As usual with “this” General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, “very quickly”. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke “P”. Since then, White House officials have taken credit for faster movement to ramp up production. “We did have a problem with GM and Ventec,” White House House advisor Peter Navarro said recently. Trump added that they “have come a long way.” As of early April, the plant in Kokomo, Ind., was “less than two weeks” away from beginning mass production. Gilead is a drug company that has been represented in White House meetings alongside other pharmaceutical executives. But the company has gotten special attention thanks to experimental antiviral drug it’s working on called Remdesivir. “It shows great promise,” said Trump. Johnson & Johnson is another company that has received mentions for its efforts to develop a vaccine. “I feel good about that, but that's down the road,” the president said. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is a third pharmaceutical company that has often been mentioned largely thanks to its track record of helping develop therapies to deal with Ebola. Honeywell, a conglomerate that produces a range of industrial products, received a White House speaking invite for its work repurposing the company’s manufacturing lines to make personal protective equipment.  In introducing CEO Darius Adamczyk, Trump said, “Darius has been somebody that I've dealt with in the past, and he's a great leader of a great company.” Trump characterized Mike Lindell, CEO of MyPillow, as “a friend of mine.” Lindell spoke at the White House on March 30 and raised eyebrows when, while standing next to Trump, said: “God gave us grace on November 8, 2016, to change the course we were on.” He added: “with our great President, Vice President, and this administration and all the great people in this country praying daily, we will get through this.”  The company has begun reorienting its manufacturing capabilities to produce face masks. On March 31, the president said he had spoken with CEOs of a range of network service providers – from Altice (ATUS) to Verizon Communications (VZ) – and said, overall, the companies were “doing an incredible job.” But the media wings of two telecom companies in the meeting have gotten particularly less favorable comments in response to questions about ongoing testing and equipment shortfalls.    Wow! @foxandfriends blew away the competition of Morning Joke (which did very poorly) on MSDNC (Another Comcast sleaze production), and @CNN’s New Day, in the Morning Television Ratings. A total blowout, but that’s what you get when you treat “Trump” fairly! CNN, owned by AT&T, has come under fire multiple times. “Always a nasty question from CNN,” Trump said during a briefing on April 4. Comcast’s media subsidiary, NBC, has also been attacked repeatedly: “I don't call it Comcast, I call it Con-cast,” Trump said on March 20 in response to a question from NBC’s Peter Alexander. (Yahoo Finance is owned by Verizon Communications.) David Taylor, CEO of Procter & Gamble, scored a White House invitation to discuss his company’s role in producing cleaning products for frontline workers. Taylor touted his company’s existing products, like Tide, and said they were working to “transform our plants to make things we've never made before, like hand sanitizers and facial masks.” Greg Hayes, CEO of United Technologies, which owns Raytheon, was at the White House to discuss the company’s work with the defense industry, on the logistics front, and also promised to immediately begin manufacturing face shields. “We stand ready to help in any way we can,” he said in the Rose Garden. “Fantastic,” Trump said right after Hayes spoke, “Great company.” Trump has heaped praise on Walmart; and Doug McMillon, Walmart’s CEO, has been invited to the White House to speak alongside other business leaders. Of their overall efforts, McMillion said, “we were eager to do our part to help serve the country.” Trump later noted “Walmart, as an example, has been really helpful to us.” The company has been singled out for offering parking lots as potential sites for drive-through testing facilities and also alongside grocery store and supply chain executives for “keeping their store stocked.” Trump has only brought up Amazon, one of Walmart’s key competitors, on a couple of occasions; he noted the company was hiring additional warehouse employees to meet a growing online delivery demand.

19,7-Apr-20,Coronavirus stimulus checks: TurboTax launches tool to help Americans who don't file tax returns,"TurboTax has launched a new stimulus registration tool in partnership with the Internal Revenue Service to help low-income Americans who don’t usually file taxes get their stimulus aid checks. The tool is free and allows people to file a minimum tax return with the IRS to determine if they’re eligible for the stimulus payment. If eligible, users will need to answer a few questions and choose whether to get the payment though direct deposit or check. “There are as many as 10 million Americans who are not required to file a tax return,” TurboTax said in a statement. “Because the IRS will use the federal tax return to determine and send individual stimulus payments, these individuals are at risk of not receiving their stimulus payment.” Read more: How to file taxes: The full breakdown Many Americans will get government checks up to $1,200 to help them financially weather job loss, reduced work hours, and other money challenges as the country tries to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Social Security recipients and people who are required to file tax returns will not need to provide additional information, but will also have to meet the eligibility criteria to get the payment. Here’s what else you need to know. “Our updated estimate is that 93.6 percent of [tax] filers will have a rebate,” said Garrett Watson, senior policy analyst at The Tax Foundation. “And this works out to approximately 140 million households.” Your eligibility is based on your most recent tax return and your adjusted gross income. If you already filed your 2019 taxes ,your eligibility will be based on that. If not, the Internal Revenue Service will use your 2018 taxes to determine if you qualify. The benefit is available not only to those who have filed taxes, but also to those who receive Social Security benefits as long as they’ve received their SSA-1099 or RB-1099 forms. Read more: Tax deadline postponed: Why you should still file as soon as you can Single adults with income up to $75,000 will get a $1,200 payment. Married couples with income up to $150,000 will get $2,400. Single parents who file as head of household with income up to $112,500 will get the full $1,200 check. Additionally, Americans who qualify for the stimulus payment and have children will get an additional $500 per child under 17. Reduced checks will be available for single adults who earn between $75,001 and $99,000 and married couples who earn between $150,001 and $198,000. The check will be reduced by $5 for every $100 over $75,000 for single adults and $150,000 for married couples. Single adults who make more than $99,000 and married couples who earn more than $198,000 won’t receive stimulus checks. Those without a Social Security number and nonresident aliens — those who aren’t a U.S. citizen or U.S. national and don’t have a green card or have not passed the substantial presence test — aren’t eligible. You’re also ineligible if your parents claim you as a dependent on their taxes. The IRS will use the direct deposit information you provided from the taxes you’ve filed either for 2019 or for 2018. If you have no direct deposit information on file or if the account provided is now closed, the IRS will mail you a check, instead. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a White House briefing on Thursday, that those Americans who have signed up for direct deposit will receive their payment within two weeks. “Social Security, you’ll get it very quickly after that,” Mnuchin said. “If we don’t have your information, you’ll have a simple web portal, you’ll upload it. If we don’t have that, we’ll send you checks in the mail.” The payments will be deposited directly into your bank account if you received your last tax refund or expect to receive this year’s refund that way. Otherwise, checks will be mailed, which could take longer to get to Americans. Adding to the complications, about 6% of U.S. adults — or 12 about 12 million Americans — do not have a checking, savings, or other bank account, according to a 2018 Federal Reserve report. The New York Times, citing IRS guidelines that detail how Americans who aren’t usually required to file tax returns will need to do so to receive payments, noted the guidance “will almost certainly mean longer waits for those who must file new returns to be eligible to receive a stimulus payment.” Americans with the lowest income will get mailed checks first, according to reporting by the Washington Post. Here’s the timetable for the first checks, per IRS documents seen by the Post: Taxpayers with income up to $10,000: April 24 Taxpayers with income up to $20,000: May 1 Taxpayers with income up to $40,000: May 15 The rest of the checks will be issued by gradually increasing income increments each week. Households earning $198,000 who file jointly will get their reduced checks on Sept. 4. The last group of checks will be sent on Sept. 11 to those who didn’t have tax information on file and had to apply for checks, according to the Washington Post. No. The stimulus payment is actually a refundable credit against your 2020 tax liability, according to Kyle Pomerleau of the American Enterprise, and is paid out as an advanced refund. That means you don’t have to wait to file your 2020 taxes to get the money. It also doesn’t reduce any refund you would otherwise receive, Watson said. In fact, if you don’t qualify for the stimulus check now based on your 2018 or 2019 tax returns, you may be able to qualify to take the tax credit next year when you file your 2020 taxes if your income meets the thresholds.

20,7-Apr-20,'Be the Light': The inspirational reason high schools nationwide are burning stadium lights during the coronavirus pandemic,"With the coronavirus crisis shutting down schools nationwide, most U.S. children won’t be returning to class this academic year. But to assure students won’t feel forgotten, schools across the country are turning on sports stadium lights to illuminate empty campuses, embracing what has become known as the #BeTheLight movement. A March 24 tweet from Dumas High School in Texas set things off. “To all the student of Dumas ISD: Tonight and every weekday night from 8 to 9 we are going to burn our stadium lights for you ... as a symbol of hope and an assurance that you are on our hearts and minds,” wrote principal Brett Beesley, challenging fellow state schools, with the hashtag #BeTheLight. Beesley tells Yahoo Lifestyle that he was driving past school during spring break, a few days before the March 30 shutdown. “My heart was hurting for our kids, and I wanted to show that we love them,” he says. “I thought, ‘It would be cool to light up the stadium.’” Head football coach Aaron Dunham got “fired up” about the idea, Beesley says, driving to the stadium that night. Later, Beesley tweeted a photo of the lit arena.        To the students of Dumas ISD: Tonight and every weekday night from 8:00 to 9:00 we are going to burn our stadium lights for you... as a symbol of hope and an assurance that you are on our hearts and minds. To the Great State of Texas: We challenge you to do the same. #bethelight pic.twitter.com/FRyAUa4Yrt Challenge accepted! We got this! <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FB> pic.twitter.com/CpabuFPUtj Eustace ISD is joining in with towns from around the state. From 8-9 we will burn our stadium lights as symbol of hope and assurance to our students, teachers, community and all who need support during this time. We may be closed... However, we are always here! #BeTheLight #1-0 pic.twitter.com/8mbDDWWXUK Irving Independent School District in Texas answered, “Challenge accepted! We got this!” tweeting a photo of its stadium, as did Eustace ISD. “The [school closure] hit me hard because our athletes worked so hard,” Monty Leaf, head football coach of Eustace High School, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “We don’t want them to feel as though time was wasted.” Each night, Leaf drives to the stadium and turns on the lights, where he sits in silence for an hour. “It’s the most peaceful hour of my day,” he says. “No one can dictate the darkness.” In Minnesota, more than 200 schools are using the hashtag #BeTheLightMN, according to activities director Paul Riess of Cloquet Public Schools. Some go on at 8:20 p.m. (translating to 2020 in military time) on certain nights, others chose Friday to symbolize canceled football games. And some time spans represent individual school district numbers. Riess, who played the school song over the stadium loud speakers on Monday night, tells Yahoo Lifestyle, “We’re also asking neighbors to turn on their porch lights each week.” Sixteen miles away, Fichtner Field lit up for Hermantown Community Schools. “These kids had the rug pulled out from under them,” district activities director Beth Clark tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “We’re thinking about them.” Superintendent Kerry Juntunen hopes to continue the event throughout the summer. When Adam Bright of the Colorado High School Association learned of the trending hashtag, he emailed five local schools. “It’s been pretty awesome to watch,” he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “The kids have connections with their coaches and we wanted a little normalcy.” Every Friday night at 8 p.m., for the remainder of the school year, the stadium at Fort Lupton High School will light up for 30 minutes, athletic director Jim Roedel tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “We’ll also do this inside the gymnasium and the drama center, where a play was scheduled.” And on Friday, the snow-covered field at Vista Ridge High School in Colorado Springs was illuminated, thanks to athletic director Brandon Monson, who established a random schedule to deter spectators. “This isn’t just for athletes,” he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “It’s symbolic of all students.”     For the latest coronavirus news and updates, follow along at https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus.

22,7-Apr-20,Why Is Warren Buffett Ignoring the Coronavirus Market Dip?,"The coronavirus has brought markets through the deepest correction since 2008. Investors are beginning to speculate what is Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett going to buy. And this makes a lot of sense. After all, it is Buffett who said “…be greedy only when others are fearful.” Over the past few weeks, the markets fell very severely, very fast. Market commentators turned bleaker every day, while the S&P 500 kept tumbling lower and lower, apart from brief periods of brutal volatility. It was a grim picture—as any market correction should be—and given that the economy is on a near complete lockdown, there are not many signs that things will soon get better, apart from one: Famous investors are beginning to look greedy. Howard Marks, one of the most careful and celebrated investors, hinted in a recent Bloomberg interview that he is out in the market buying. Marks seemed rather optimistic; indeed, he has been complaining about how dear the market has become for some time now.    Related Universa’s Mark Spitznagel on Making Money While Markets Crash     Carl Icahn said similar things during a recent appearance on CNBC, as did some other investors, like Mark Cuban. While Icahn thinks the markets may still have a long way to go down, he is buying. These moves by professional investors might seem like good news. The problem is, this time, they are not alone. Every day, over the past three weeks, market news reporters have been asking the same question: “Should you buy the dip?” This may be a cultural thing. The 2008 financial crisis was a deep crisis. It triggered a hatred for bankers, and a lot of interest in finance and Wall Street. The proliferation of low-level education on YouTube, blogs and other social media triggered a lot of self-education by people outside of the finance industry. Jason Zweig of the Wall Street Journal thinks that this time is different—this time, large fund managers must sell over fears of losing their jobs, while the small investors can afford to wait it out. This all may seem like borderline madness when you look at the markets: The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have fallen by more than 30 percent from their all-time highs just a few weeks back. Major exchanges have seen circuit breakers go off amid systematic selling. March 12 was the worst day for stock markets since 1987. But however painful it felt, it could have been much, much worse.    Related Navigating the Financial Markets During a Global Pandemic     With the ETFs total size reported to be $4 trillion at the peak of the market in July 2019, there were still many more mom-and-pop investors that weren’t out there selling. And given that ETFs allow their investors to get their money back very quickly, we could have seen indiscriminate sell-off of a completely different magnitude. Vanguard, the second largest provider of ETFs, reported that despite the market tumble, it’s seeing massive inflows back into its equity ETFs. Even on March 9, when markets fell on the oil shock, Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF had net inflows. Vanguard’s data is at odds with its competitors BlackRock and State Street. They have both seen outflows on the bad days in recent weeks, which may also be because their products are more popular with traders rather than long-term investors, who often prefer Vanguard. State Street’s S&P 500 ETF (SPY), for example, is used by short-term traders. Matt Sommer of Janus Henderson says that respondents in their survey, which was conducted on retail investors and savers, are, in fact, still calm and very bullish on the market. So, there is something to it: People really seem to think the market will come back strong—soon. And if retail investors are waiting it out, then hedge funds are certainly doing so too. Mandy Xu of Credit Suisse says that “if you look at the equity long short, the long-only institution community, we’re not seeing widespread de-leveraging from that community yet.” What she means is that despite the selling, large investment funds are still very bullish on equities—many of them are repositioning and changing their hedges, but they are still in the market, many of them with large long equity positions with borrowed money. This was echoed by several other traders and analysts commenting on the market on Bloomberg and CNBC over the recent week. This is not something that we can easily check, unless we do it ex-post (i.e. through 13F filings), but since traders see their clients’ moves in real time, these comments should be taken into account.

Callan, one of the largest consultancies to pension funds, and other large institutional investors are giving their clients clear advice: Wait it out, don’t sell. The expensive markets have kept Buffett on the sideline for some time now. Aside from the $10 billion Occidental Petroleum deal, both Buffett and Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway’s vice chairman and Buffett’s right-hand man, remained passive, growing their $125 billion war chest. Indeed, many have wondered if Buffett will ever get a chance to act again. There lies the difference between Buffett and others—he thinks in decades, not years. Here it is: The market fall has finally come, and it has taken a form that no one could have expected. The world was certainly not prepared for this, and the markets are hurting. So, are they finally cheap enough for Buffett to act? Maybe not. In contrast to some other famous investors, Warren Buffett doesn’t seem as bullish. The ETF flows and high volatility show that people are waiting to buy the dip. It’s clear why. For more than a decade now, we’ve lived in a world where every single market correction has been quickly pushed back up to another all-time high. This idea that the markets tend to recover quickly is in our muscle memory. The conviction seems strong. Michael Hartnett of Bank of America expects that once the current panic starts to fade it will “induce [a] major rotation” into growth stocks and bond proxies, such as high-dividend payers, FAANG stocks, software, mortgage REITs, utilities and inflation-sensitive sectors, like Asian equities, emerging market stocks and oil. In other words, the expectation is that when the panic stops, we’ll all pile right back into the same trades. That widespread, if invisible, optimism might be precisely the reason why we have not reached the bottom yet. If we know anything, it is that Warren Buffett doesn’t rush things. He is not interested in buying a short-term market dip but making a strategic move.    Related Carson Block on Short Selling in the Time of Coronavirus     The widespread panic from coronavirus sent markets everywhere sharply down, and some more traditional sectors were hit particularly hard. Buffett is hurting, too—estimates vary, but it could be as much as $70 billion, given his large portfolio in U.S. equities. It has also been reported that Buffett sold a large part of his positions in Delta Air Lines and about 4 percent in Southwest Airlines Co. As soon as the news broke, people began speculating about what it could mean. A loss of faith in the airlines’ ability to ever recover? Buffett still owns around 9 percent in Delta, as well as a large position in American Airlines and United Airlines. It is unlikely that he is planning to sell more later, as the price is most likely to drop further still. And yet, he didn’t sell all of his positions, which means he wants to keep a stake. His divestment may have also been part of a larger government restructuring plan currently being negotiated. It is unlikely that Buffett will start buying anytime soon. The markets may still have some room to go down, but that is not what drives Buffett’s decisions anyway. Instead, he will try to reassess how good some businesses are and whether or not the coronavirus pandemic changed anything fundamentally in consumer sentiment. His large equity positions in many companies give him the unique benefit of understanding what is happening inside those companies and how consumer sentiment is turning. One thing is clear: He will go big. Making large investments in one of the badly hit industries post-coronavirus would be a typical Buffett move. He invested in JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America when people shunned bankers after 2008. Indeed, for Buffett the only thing that matters is the quality of the business, since, as he said in his 1988 letter to shareholders: “…[his] favorite holding period is forever.” George Salapa is a co-founder of bardicredit GmbH, a Swiss advisory.

23,7-Apr-20,8 Dividends In Danger Of Being Cut,"With interest rates at all-time lows, income investors have few places to turn for solid yields. To make things even more difficult, the (coronavirus) COVID-19 stock market sell-off has already triggered a handful of companies to cut or suspend their dividends. Red Flags Not only do dividend cuts drive away income investors, they're also a sign of potential liquidity issues at the underlying company. The sell-off has driven dividend yields of a number of S&P 500 stocks to their highest levels in years. But as attractive as a double-digit dividend may seem on the surface, a dividend is only as good as the company paying it. The quickest way to assess the reliability of a dividend is to look at a company’s payout ratio. A payout ratio is a measure of the percentage of a company's EPS that is going back out to meet its dividend payment obligations. Ideally, a healthy dividend stock will have a payout ratio at or below 50%, but anything approaching 100% or higher is often a sign that the payout is unsustainable. Another red flag for investors to watch for is dividend yields that are too good to be true. A handful of real estate investment trusts and other companies pay yields at or above 8%, but most companies never intend to have yields that high. In many cases, stocks with yields that high have suffered large sell-offs that drove the payouts higher relative to the share price and could also indicate fundamental problems at the company. See Also: Exxon's CEO On How Oil Giant Plans To Maintain Dividend, Focus On Balance Sheet Dividends At Risk Here are eight S&P 500 stocks with dividend yields of at least 7% and payout ratios of above 100%, according to Finviz. Benzinga’s Take Dividend investors looking for yield should tread very carefully in the market these days.

25,7-Apr-20,Billionaire Steven Cohen Picks up These 2 Stocks on the Dip,"Stocks roared higher on Monday, but one legendary hedge fund manager isn’t breaking out the champagne just yet. Optimism that COVID-19's spread may be slowing powered the market’s impressive rally, with the Dow Jones closing the session up by over 1,600 points. That said, it may be too early to start toasting to the market’s recovery and the end of dramatic volatility. Billionaire Steve Cohen is warning staff of his investment firm, Point72 Asset Management, to stay cautious as stocks rebound from the COVID-19-driven sell-off. “Markets don’t come back in a straight line; after an earthquake there are tremors... We need to continue to be disciplined. We are seeing plenty of opportunities to generate returns, but I don’t want us taking undue risks,” he wrote in an internal note. The Point72 Chairman and CEO has earned a reputation as one of the most successful stock pickers, with his firm relying on a core hedge fund strategy that features stock market investments. Less frequently, Point72, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut, will make plays based on macro trends, placing global wagers on several asset classes at the same time. With Cohen earning an estimated $1.3 billion in 2019 after the firm’s main hedge fund posted a 14.9% gain, it’s no wonder market watchers follow his moves religiously. Taking all of this into consideration, we used TipRanks’ database to take a closer look at two stocks Cohen snapped up recently on the dip. The platform revealed that both Buy-rated tickers have earned the support of some members of the analyst community as well. Calithera Bio (CALA) Calithera Bio uses a onco-metabolism approach that brings a unique perspective to cancer, with it developing small molecule therapies that disrupt cellular metabolic pathways to block tumor growth. While shares have fallen 17% year-to-date to reach $4.74 apiece, this price tag could be an ideal entry point for those looking to get in on the action. This is the stance taken by Steve Cohen. According to a March 13 disclosure, Point72 added a CALA holding to its portfolio, in the shape of 3,240,046 shares. As a result, Cohen’s firm now has a 5% stake in the healthcare company. Weighing in on CALA for Jeffries, analyst Biren Amin sees an opportunity as well. He notes that a significant component of his bullish thesis is its CB-839 candidate. There is a substantial unmet need for successful outcomes in second- and third-line renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as checkpoint inhibitors are designated for first line use. As the candidate has already demonstrated efficacy in RCC, the top-line data readout in the second half of 2020 could serve as a key catalyst. Not to mention Amin estimates peak U.S. sales of $21 million for RCC alone. Adding to the good news, CB-839 could potentially be used to treat non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with KEAP1/NRF2 mutations. “With no currently approved therapies for this patient sub-group, CB-839 has the potential to be first-to-market in this 13,000 patient population (recall, KRAS G12c is ~14,000 NSCLC)…We estimate peak U.S. sales for CB-839 of $204 million (risk adj) for KEAP1/ NRF2 mutant NSCLC,” Amin commented. With the analyst pointing out that its two arginase inhibitors in development, INCB001158 as part of a collaboration with Incyte and CB-280, stand to drive additional upside, it makes sense that Amin takes a bullish approach. All in all, the five-star analyst puts a Buy rating on Calithera shares along with a $6 price target. Should the target be met, a twelve-month gain of 27% could be in store. (To watch Amin’s track record, click here) Like the Jeffries analyst, the rest of the Street is bullish on CALA. 4 Buy ratings compared to no Holds or Sells add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $6.67, the average price target is more aggressive than Amin’s and implies upside potential of 41%. (See Calithera stock analysis on TipRanks) Syros Pharmaceuticals (SYRS) With the goal of taking control of gene expression, Syros develops small molecules to help improve the lives of patients. March definitely wasn’t its month, but some members of the Street believe its long-term growth prospects are strong. Cohen falls into this category. Made public on April 2, Point72 pulled the trigger on this healthcare stock. Acquiring a new holding, its purchase of 2.3 million shares puts the firm’s total stake in SYRS at 5.1%. Turning now to the analyst community, Roth Capital’s Zegbeh Jallah told investors that SYRS’s fourth quarter earnings results demonstrate the company’s potential. “We believe that Syros has made steady progress over 2019, and we look forward to the multiple data readouts expected during, particularly the readout of SY-1425 in r/r AML which should be a major catalyst. Cash and cash equivalents are expected to be sufficient to fund operations beyond major catalysts, and into 2022,” he explained. During the quarter, the company released data for its lead candidate, SY-1425, a selective RARa agonist currently in a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The therapy was not only able to show a 62% CR/CRi rate and an 82% rate of transfusion independence, but it also produced a fast onset of action, was tolerable as a combination with Azacitidine and validated the biomarker strategy for patient selection. “The focus will likely be on response durability, which will probably be extrapolated to gauge the potential for durable responses in the r/r AML setting, for which Syros hopes to pursue an accelerated regulatory pathway,” Jallah added. On top of this, proof-of-concept data from the Phase 2 study of SY-1425 and Aza in r/r AML, which is slated for release in the fourth quarter of 2020, could drive significant growth for the company. Jallah is also watching out for an update on initial PK/PD and safety data from the Phase 1 study of SY-5609, its first oral and noncovalent CDK7 inhibitor. Bearing this in mind, Jallah has high hopes for SYRS. Along with a Buy rating, the analyst left a $17 price target on the stock, indicating 146% upside potential. (To watch Jallah’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, opinions are split evenly down the middle. With 2 Buys and 2 Holds received in the last three months, the word on the Street is that SYRS is a Moderate Buy. Based on the $9.33 average price target, the upside potential comes in at 35%.

26,8-Apr-20,Coronavirus update: New York sees surge of deaths after brief respite; Trump says WHO 'really blew it',"The global coronavirus outbreak showed few signs of abating on Tuesday, as the U.S. added to its status as the world’s epicenter of new infections, while New York suffered its worst day yet of new fatalities. Worldwide, COVID-19 infections are creeping toward 1.5 million, according to real-time data from Johns Hopkins, with America topping the list by far with nearly 400,000 diagnosed infections. Both California and New York on Tuesday reported sharply higher cases and fatalities, underscoring how the crisis is far from over despite budding optimism over an eventual plateauing of casualties. Cases in Europe also continued to rise, but declining rates of new infections in hotspots like Italy and Spain offered some measure of hope, even as Frace saw its death rate top 10,000. In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson remained hospitalized in intensive care as his condition worsened — the latest and highest profile victim of an outbreak that’s claimed over 80,000 lives around the world. Separately, U.S. policymakers are debating new ways to shore up an economy that has all but certainly tumbled into a deep recession. As stocks rallied on optimism that new infections could soon peak, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was working with Congress on fresh aid to small businesses worth at least $250 billion, with the Senate poised to vote on the move as early as Thursday. However, officials are still engaged in a furious debate about whether and when to restart economic activity. With April all but certain to feature more grim COVID-19 figures, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters the Trump administration’s efforts to reopen the economy would be contingent upon advice from public health officials. Yet normalcy is unlikely to occur until a vaccine is found, and mass testing can identify larger numbers of people infected by the virus. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo acknowledged as much on Tuesday, telling reporters at his daily briefing that diagnosing the infected was a linchpin to normalizing public life. The Empire State reported 731 deaths in a day — its worst yet after two days in which the figure appeared to be hitting a plateau. However, new hospitalizations have slowed, a critical metric amid a badly-strained health care system that’s overwhelmed the state’s medical professionals. “It's all about testing, testing, testing,” Cuomo said. “We have done more testing than any state in the nation, but we need to do even more.” Ezekiel Emanuel, a former health policy adviser under President Barack Obama, told Yahoo Finance’s “The Ticker” on Monday that the U.S. was “not going to get rid of this, or be past it, or return to full normalcy until that vaccine is available.” Emanuel’s remarks echoed those of Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who said on Monday that getting “back to normal” would entail being able to “completely protect the population” from the pathogen.  Dr. Fauci: ""If 'back to normal' means acting like there never was a Coronavirus problem, I don't think that's going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population.""Full video here: https://t.co/7Ym0v60MGM pic.twitter.com/xudXB1p6u7 China on Tuesday ordered the lifting of stiff restrictions on Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus first appeared late last year. Yet in recent days, the government has faced pointed questions about its transparency in reporting new infections and deaths, with U.S. intelligence reportedly finding that Beijing understated its COVID-19 fatalities. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has also taken rising heat for its role in downplaying the severity of the outbreak early on. President Donald Trump, who has also sustained criticism for his handling of the crisis, lashed out at the agency for a “China-centric” approach that appeared to show favoritism toward Beijing.    The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation? On Tuesday, Trump removed the independent watchdog meant to oversee the use of the $2 trillion stimulus package that passed last week, while the acting Navy Secretary resigned in the wake of a furor surrounding a captain who went public with a plea for help on a coronavirus-stricken air carrier. This week is likely to pose the stiffest challenge yet to the world’s largest economy, with officials warning that the coming weeks will see a surge in new cases and deaths. Although major benchmarks have staged a comeback from a brutal sell-off, the looming first-quarter earnings season is likely to provide a stark reminder to investors over the damage wrought by the pandemic. “We expect volatility to remain elevated until the number of COVID-19 cases peak or is contained,” said Terry Sandven, U.S. Bank Wealth Management chief equity strategist. Next week will bring the first wave of Q1 earnings reports, Sandven noted, with earnings expected to drop by at least 5%, according to FactSet data. “Investor focus undoubtedly will be on tone and mindset around how companies may operate during the remainder of 2020,” he added.

27,7-Apr-20,Trump says he never saw a January WH memo warning of the impact from coronavirus,"At Tuesday’s coronavirus task force briefing, President Trump said he never saw a memo written in late January by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro warning about the possible effects of coronavirus in the United States. The memo warned that the illness could endanger the lives of millions of Americans."
28,7-Apr-20,Investor who predicted the start of the 2009 bull market: Beware of a double bottom,"Legendary investor Mark Mobius is famous for a lot of things over the course of his nearly half-century career managing money, but even among his many accolades his prescient prediction of the beginning of the 2009 bull market stands out. Perhaps it’s because it not only proved to be correct, but also proved to be the call that started the longest-running bull market in U.S. history. But when he was asked Monday if the recent 20% rally off the bottom of the quickest bear market in history signaled an all-clear for investors, Mobius cautioned investors and stopped short of echoing his 2009 call. “I think it's a little early to predict that because given the lockdown that we have seen globally in so many countries around the world, the impact of this lockdown on businesses, it's not going to be seen immediately,” the Mobius Capital Partners founder told Yahoo Finance’s YFi PM. “So I believe that once the numbers start coming in, people will be somewhat disappointed.” So far, at least, investors haven’t balked at the disastrous numbers of Americans filing unemployment claims. The past two weeks have set consecutive records for the sheer droves of jobless claims, totaling nearly 10 million. The S&P 500 has rallied nearly 20% over the same time period, despite the gloomy unemployment update, bringing the total peak-to-trough decline since the coronavirus crisis hit to a 20% drawdown. As Mobius points out, historical bear markets on a global scale have averaged a larger 30% to 50% drawdown spread out over the span of roughly two years. Some have been quick to optimistically predict, however, that if the market cratered at record speed, perhaps it could recover just as fast because this time it is different. To refute the notion that lightning could strike just as quick to fuel an equal move to the upside, Mobius quoted the late John Templeton. “The most expensive words in the world are ‘This time is different.’ I don't think this time it's different,” he said. “I think we’re probably maybe going to do a double bottom, jumping down again and pushing up again.” That said, Mobius did concede the fact that the drawdown has brought on what he sees as attractive opportunities in some emerging markets like China, India and Brazil. For an investor looking to diversify, the noted emerging markets guru recommended a defensive strategy of allocating at least 10% of a portfolio to gold and 30% to 40% in emerging markets while saving a large cash cushion should the market take another leg lower. “The reason why I think it's a good idea to keep reserves in cash [is] because I don’t think it’s over,” he said. “If you've got millions of unemployment claims, that means a lot of people will not be returning to the same jobs that they were at before.” Thursday will bring what’s expected to be yet another dire update to America’s unemployment picture. According to Mobius, things are likely to continue to get worse before they get better. “The recovery may take longer than people expect,” he predicted, barring any absence of a New Deal-like work program. “It's going to be a real challenge to get these people back to work.” Zack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Christoforous, Brian Sozzi, Heidi Chung and Julia La Roche discuss the details. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham is leaving her job after less than a year and returning to her position as first lady Melania Trump's chief of staff, according to a report from CNN published on Tuesday. The New York Times subsequently reported that Kayleigh McEnany, the national press secretary for President Trump's 2020 campaign, would replace Grisham in the press secretary post, which is traditionally the most visible public face of the White House. Grisham, Trump's third press secretary, has not held a briefing with the White House press corps since taking the job late last June. Another approach is to harvest antibodies, protective substances produced in response to an infection, from the blood plasma of people who have been infected. Dr. Jacob Glanville, one of the researchers featured in the Netflix documentary “Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,” thinks he has found a shortcut. Glanville is the president of Distributed Bio, a computational immunoengineering group that focuses on making antibody therapeutics and vaccines. Stark statistics from Chicago health officials have underscored the heavy toll of coronavirus on black Americans. Black Chicagoans account for half of all coronavirus cases in the city and more than 70% of deaths, despite making up 30% of the population. Other cities with large black populations, including Detroit, Milwaukee, New Orleans and New York, have become coronavirus hotspots. WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court refused Monday to hear the Catholic Church's challenge to a local ban on religious advertising. The case, brought by the Archdiocese of Washington against the District of Columbia region's mass transit system, would have been the latest example of religious freedom appeals heard by the conservative-leaning court. The justices already are considering four major religion cases, all brought to them by religious organizations after lower court losses: • School choice: Three Montana women challenged a Montana ban on state funds being used to pay for religious education. Alex Brandon/AP US Surgeon General Jerome Adams adopted a positive note Tuesday, saying he felt ""a lot more optimistic"" that the United States would emerge ""stronger"" from its battle with the coronavirus. On Sunday, he said he expected the virus ""to be our Pearl Harbor moment and our 9/11 moment, only it's not going to be localized, it's going to be happening all over the country."" Adams credited social distancing for his hopeful demeanor, stressing that Americans ""have the power to change the trajectory of this epidemic if we come together like we have after past tragedies in this country."" China demanded an explanation from Brazil Monday after the far-right government's education minister linked the coronavirus pandemic to the Asian country's ""plan for world domination,"" in a tweet imitating a Chinese accent. In the latest incident to strain ties between Brasilia and Beijing, Education Minister Abraham Weintraub insinuated China was behind the global health crisis. ""Geopolitically, who will come out stronger from this global crisis?"" he wrote on Twitter Saturday. The Wisconsin Supreme Court Monday evening overruled a decision by the state's governor to postpone their primary election from this week to June, putting the Tuesday election back on just hours after the the governor had tried to push it back. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers on Monday morning issued an executive order to postpone state elections scheduled for Tuesday until June 9, a dramatic last-minute move that capped weeks of indecision by state leaders. But Monday evening, the state's highest court overruled that decision in a 4-2 vote, with the vote breaking down along partisan lines, with Republican judges in the majority. India's financial hub Mumbai is set to extend lockdown measures until at least April 30 as authorities race to expand testing to stem the spread of coronavirus cases in the city, three senior officials said. A 21-day nationwide lockdown that Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared in late March to fight the epidemic is officially set to end on April 14. The Mumbai municipal authority and the state government in the western state of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, both declined to comment. After 76 days in lockdown, the Chinese city at the heart of the global pandemic reopened Wednesday, and tens of thousands immediately hopped on trains and planes to leave. Elsewhere, the economic, political and psychological toll of fighting the virus grew increasingly clear and more difficult to bear. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a second night in intensive care with his country in the grips of its biggest crisis since World War II. The 55-year-old Johnson, the first major world leader confirmed to have COVID-19, was stable and responding to treatment, spokesman James Slack said. One of those is a doctorate in economics (the other is a master's in public policy), but Navarro has used it to suggest that he has broad expertise related to the coronavirus crisis. On Monday, he argued on air with CNN anchor John Berman, who asked him about the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment. Over the weekend, there had been reports that Navarro had clashed bitterly on the matter with Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top National Institutes of Health epidemiologist who is on the coronavirus task force. A reporter at Tuesday's White House coronavirus press briefing raised the question many, many parents want answered: How soon will the kids be going back to school? This school year is probably out in most of the country, but what about summer school? Vice President Mike Pence, who was at the lectern, thanked America's teachers for adjusting to remote learning. China has reported no new deaths from coronavirus anywhere in the country, for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak. For months now, every morning at 03:00, officials in China have put together the latest figures on the spread of the virus to share with the world. World Health Organization Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed China for the ""speed with which [it] detected the outbreak"" and its ""commitment to transparency"".

An image of Democratic presidential frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden shared more than 2,000 times on Facebook purports to show Biden sticking a gun in an elderly woman's mouth. The accompanying text claims it happened at a 2019 rally in Wisconsin. A court in India's Kerala state said Tuesday it wanted to avoid ""a CATastrophe"" by allowing a man to break a coronavirus lockdown to buy food for his furry felines. The pun was included in a ruling by Kerala's High Court on a petition brought by N. Prakash, a Kochi-based owner of three cats, who said he was denied a pass by police to leave his home. The lockdown was imposed from March 25 for 21 days, with residents permitted to leave their homes only for essential services such as buying groceries and medicine. The Los Angeles Times warned in an editorial last month that the COVID-19 pandemic threatened not only the health of individuals but the democratic process. The Supreme Court exacerbated that infection Monday when the justices blocked a lower court's decision to extend the period in which Wisconsin voters could mail in absentee ballots. On Monday the state Supreme Court rebuffed an attempt by Wisconsin's Democratic governor to suspend in-person voting on Tuesday and expand voting by mail. China is investigating a prominent Communist Party member who criticized leader Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Police in Bangladesh arrested a fugitive killer of the country's independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Tuesday, nearly 45 years after the brutal assassination, the country's home minister said. Abdul Majed, a former military captain, was arrested in the capital, Dhaka, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said, adding that the arrest was “the biggest gift” for Bangladesh this year. Majed had publicly announced his involvement in the assassination after the killing and had reportedly been hiding in India for many years. Dr. Deborah Birx, one of the two leading medical experts on the White House coronavirus task force, said that out of deference to social distancing rules she had stayed away from her daughter's house — despite her 10-month-old granddaughter having registered a fever of 105 degrees over the weekend. Birx said the child, who is recovering, probably had roseola, a common childhood infection, not COVID-19. Birx, who meets daily with President Trump and Vice President Pence, said she has been vigilant about avoiding social contact “because of you two.” Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has approved the withdrawal of 1 billion euros from the country's sovereign wealth fund to help fight the coronavirus epidemic, President Hassan Rouhani's official website said on Monday. Provinces and cities across China are slowly lifting their strict coronavirus lockdown measures. Wuhan, where the coronavirus broke out, just lifted its lockdown. After people fill out a quick health survey, the software issues them with a colored health code — green, yellow, or red — which dictates whether they can leave the house and where they can go. LONDON—The British prime minister Boris Johnson was admitted to intensive care Monday in a shock development that followed days of Downing Street playing down the severity of his illness. It's the first time in more than a half a century that a British prime minister has been incapacitated while in office. Downing Street tried to keep up the appearance that Johnson was well enough to lead the country over the last 24 hours, but it has become increasingly clear that the 55-year-old is seriously ill. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing criticism for creating a new coronavirus relief fund when about $500 million was lying unspent in an older fund, even as top businesses and celebrities pledge millions of dollars in new donations. Modi launched the ""PM CARES"" fund to provide relief to those affected by the coronavirus that has infected more than 5,000 people in India, and killed 149. The fund is expected to help millions of day labourers, many of whose lives were devastated by a nationwide lockdown ordered by Modi to stem the epidemic.

30,3-Apr-20,When Will I Get My Stimulus Check?,"The Trump administration keeps telling us that the economic stimulus checks authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act will start going out by mid-April. And now, according to The Washington Post, the IRS has a plan to do just that. However, that doesn't mean everyone will get paid in April. In fact, it looks like some Americans won't get stimulus money until September. (Use our Stimulus Check Calculator to see how much you'll be getting. For additional information on stimulus checks and payments, see Your 2020 Stimulus Check: How Much? When? And Other Questions Answered.) The IRS reportedly will start issuing electronic payments through direct deposit on April 9. Those payments should arrive in taxpayers' bank accounts by April 14. Will you get an electronic payment? It depends on whether the IRS has your bank account information. If you signed up for direct deposit of a refund on your 2018 or 2019 tax return, then the IRS has all the information it needs to pay you electronically. If you haven't filed your 2019 return yet, you still have time before the IRS starts issuing electronic payments if you want your money as soon as possible. You might even get a bigger stimulus check if you file your 2019 tax return now. (On the other hand, you could get more money by waiting to file your return--it all depends on your own situation.) If you receive Social Security benefits and typically don't file a tax return, the IRS will use information from your Social Security benefits statement to calculate the stimulus check amount. They will also send your stimulus payment electronically if that's how you normally receive your Social Security payments. For other people who usually don't file a tax return, the IRS plans to create an online portal in the next few weeks where you can file a ""simple return"" to provide your bank account information. If a direct deposit payment is rejected (e.g., if the bank account information is incorrect), the IRS will mail you a paper check instead. If the IRS has to send you a paper check, you won't get your payment until late April at best. And the higher your income, the longer it will take to get your money. (For taxpayers without children, stimulus check amounts are reduced to zero for single taxpayers with adjusted gross income above $99,000, head-of-household filers with AGI above $136,500, and joint filers with AGI above $198,000.) According to reports, here's the timetable the IRS plans to use for mailing paper stimulus checks: Taxpayer Income Date Check Mailed $0 to $10,000 April 24 $10,001 to $20,000 May 1 $20,001 to $30,000 May 8 $30,001 to $40,000 May 15 $40,001 to $50,000 May 22 $50,001 to $60,000 May 29 $60,001 to $70,000 June 5 $70,001 to $80,000 June 12 $80,001 to $90,000 June 19 $90,001 to $100,000 June 26 $100,001 to $110,000 July 3 $110,001 to $120,000 July 10 $120,001 to $130,000 July 17 $130,001 to $140,000 July 24 $140,001 to $150,000 July 31 $150,001 to $160,000 August 7 $160,001 to $170,000 August 14 $170,001 to $180,000 August 21 $180,001 to $190,000 August 28 $190,001 to $200,000 September 4 All Others September 11 If you don't want to wait this long to get a stimulus check, file your 2019 tax return as soon as possible so that the IRS has the information it needs to send your payment electronically. If you otherwise aren't required to file a return, file a ""simple return"" when the IRS makes them available on its website.

32,8-Apr-20,"Coronavirus, FOMC minutes: What to know in markets Wednesday","Fears surrounding the rapid spread of COVID-19 and rising death toll will continue to weigh on sentiment Wednesday. As of Tuesday afternoon, there were more than 1.4 million confirmed cases and 80,759 deaths around the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The U.S. currently has the most infections in the world with more than 383,000 confirmed cases and 12,021 deaths. After a brief glimmer of hope, the situation in New York City took a turn for the worst Tuesday when the city announced its largest number of new cases in one day and its worst day in terms of fatalities. Volatility creeped back into the market Tuesday, when after surging as much as 900 points, the Dow rapidly pared gains and ended the session in negative territory. The Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) meeting minutes from its scheduled March meeting and emergency meetings will be released Wednesday afternoon. “The minutes of the emergency FOMC meeting in early March, and the mid-March meeting which was held two days earlier than scheduled, may not contain many new insights given how rapidly the economic landscape has been changing over the past couple of weeks,” Capital Economics said in a note April 3. While the minutes will unlikely reveal many new insights, it will provide more context, according to Nomura. “Given the number of actions taken during March after the 15 March meeting, and the rapidly deteriorating outlook over the month, the minutes may be somewhat stale. However, they may provide more context for how much the Fed is willing to utilize its existing authority or whether any participants suggested seeking an expansion of that authority,” the firm said in a note April 3. — Heidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.

33,8-Apr-20,GM signs $490M contract under Defense Production Act to build ventilators to fight coronavirus pandemic,"General Motors has signed a federal contract worth nearly $490 million to build ventilators amid the coronavirus crisis, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed early Wednesday. The U.S. government said the deal was awarded under the Defense Production Act, which the president activated to press GM into manufacturing devices to help alleviate the shortage of personal protective equipment at hospitals treating COVID-19 patients. The contract, which the Department of Health and Human Services described as the first under the Defense Production Act, calls for GM to deliver 30,000 ventilators to the country's Strategic National Stockpile by the end of August 2020. Under the initial production schedule, GM will deliver 6,132 ventilators by June 1, 2020.  Hospitals in hotspots like New York have been clamoring for more ventilators to treat patients who need help breathing, saying they could face shortages without immediate action GM said it's partnering with Ventec Life Systems and is ""working with speed and urgency to arm front-line medical professionals with the critical care ventilators they need to treat seriously ill patients."" The automaker will produce the ventilators at its plant in Kokomo, Indiana. Under the federal mandate, HHS is authorized to compel GM to ""accept, perform and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators."" Volume production is expected to begin the week of April 13. Ford, GM's archrival, is also making ventilators in partnership with GE Healthcare, as well as other equipment such as face shields. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said his company would also make them.

38,8-Apr-20,Moleculin Announces Active Compound in WP1122 Reduces Coronavirus Replication In Vitro by 100%,"Independent research shows 2-DG activity against virus that causes COVID-19 HOUSTON, April 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Moleculin Biotech, Inc., (Nasdaq: MBRX) (""Moleculin"" or the ""Company""), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a broad portfolio of drug candidates, today announced that independent research found 2-deoxy-D-glucose (""2-DG"") to reduce replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by 100% in in vitro testing. Researchers at the University of Frankfurt disclosed the findings in their article submitted to NatureResearch on March 11, 2020 (Bojkova, D et al; DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-17218/v1) (https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-17218/v1). The authors reported that inhibiting glycolysis with non-toxic concentrations of 2-DG completely prevented SARS-CoV–2 replication in Caco–2 cells.  Glycolysis is a process by which cells convert glucose into energy and infected (host) cells are induced by viruses to dramatically increase their dependence on glycolysis.  2-DG inhibits glycolysis because, although it appears to cells to be glucose, it is in fact a decoy that cannot be converted into energy. Moleculin's drug candidate, WP1122, is referred to as a ""prodrug"" of 2-DG whereby chemical elements are added to 2-DG to improve its delivery in vivo.  Once administered, these added elements are removed by normal metabolic processes and what remains is 2-DG. As a result, 2-DG is the active compound in WP1122.  In chemical terms, it is referred to as the active ""moiety"" (subpart) of WP1122. ""This is the breakthrough we were looking for, only it came from an unexpected source,"" commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and CEO of Moleculin. ""Normally, we wouldn't have access to data like this until it is published, but the willingness of the authors to pre-release this data will help support our development of WP1122 for treating COVID-19."" Dr. Don Picker, Chief Science Officer of Moleculin explained: ""2-DG is what we call the 'active moiety' in WP1122.  The problem with 2-DG is that it is metabolized by the body too quickly, so you can't get enough concentration in human tissues and organs to be therapeutic.  Therefore, even though 2-DG is active against a range of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, it isn't useful as a clinical therapy because it's too rapidly metabolized.  WP1122 appears to solve this problem because it is a 'prodrug' of 2-DG.  Its structure enables it to achieve much higher tissue/organ concentrations than 2-DG alone, but once it's in the cell, it metabolizes into the exact same 2-DG that is so effective in vitro."" Moleculin's Chief Medical Officer – New Projects, Dr. Sandra Silberman added: ""The FDA has cleared the way for very rapid development of COVID-19 therapies, so we should be able to move WP1122 into the clinics on an expedited basis.  Fortunately, it has a very good safety profile in mice.  We are in the process of demonstrating safety in additional species before submitting our IND (Investigational New Drug application).  Since it has better drug-like properties than 2-DG, WP1122 also actually works better in the animal tumor models we have been studying. We think this bodes well for its potential as a more potent drug than 2-DG as an antiviral agent against coronavirus.""
